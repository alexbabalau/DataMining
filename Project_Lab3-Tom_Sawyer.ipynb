      "Most of the adventures recorded in this book really occurred; one or two\r\n",
      "were experiences of my own, the rest those of boys who were schoolmates\r\n",
      "of mine. Huck Finn is drawn from life; Tom Sawyer also, but not from an\r\n",
      "individual—he is a combination of the characteristics of three boys whom\r\n",
      "I knew, and therefore belongs to the composite order of architecture.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The odd superstitions touched upon were all prevalent among children and\r\n",
      "slaves in the West at the period of this story—that is to say, thirty or\r\n",
      "forty years ago.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Although my book is intended mainly for the entertainment of boys and\r\n",
      "girls, I hope it will not be shunned by men and women on that account,\r\n",
      "for part of my plan has been to try to pleasantly remind adults of what\r\n",
      "they once were themselves, and of how they felt and thought and talked,\r\n",
      "and what queer enterprises they sometimes engaged in.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Within two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his troubles. Not\r\n",
      "because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a\r\n",
      "man’s are to a man, but because a new and powerful interest bore\r\n",
      "them down and drove them out of his mind for the time—just as men’s\r\n",
      "misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises. This new\r\n",
      "interest was a valued novelty in whistling, which he had just acquired\r\n",
      "from a negro, and he was suffering to practise it un-disturbed. It\r\n",
      "consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of liquid warble,\r\n",
      "produced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short\r\n",
      "intervals in the midst of the music—the reader probably remembers how to\r\n",
      "do it, if he has ever been a boy. Diligence and attention soon gave him\r\n",
      "the knack of it, and he strode down the street with his mouth full of\r\n",
      "harmony and his soul full of gratitude. He felt much as an astronomer\r\n",
      "feels who has discovered a new planet—no doubt, as far as strong, deep,\r\n",
      "unalloyed pleasure is concerned, the advantage was with the boy, not the\r\n",
      "astronomer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The summer evenings were long. It was not dark, yet. Presently Tom\r\n",
      "checked his whistle. A stranger was before him—a boy a shade larger\r\n",
      "than himself. A new-comer of any age or either sex was an im-pressive\r\n",
      "curiosity in the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg. This boy\r\n",
      "was well dressed, too—well dressed on a week-day. This was simply\r\n",
      "astounding. His cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue cloth\r\n",
      "roundabout was new and natty, and so were his pantaloons. He had shoes\r\n",
      "on—and it was only Friday. He even wore a necktie, a bright bit of\r\n",
      "ribbon. He had a citified air about him that ate into Tom’s vitals. The\r\n",
      "more Tom stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned up his nose\r\n",
      "at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to\r\n",
      "him to grow. Neither boy spoke. If one moved, the other moved—but only\r\n",
      "sidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face and eye to eye all the\r\n",
      "time. Finally Tom said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I can lick you!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’d like to see you try it.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Can’t!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "An uncomfortable pause. Then Tom said:\r\n",

      "“’Tisn’t any of your business, maybe.”\r\n",

      "“Much—much—_much_. There now.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, you think you’re mighty smart, _don’t_ you? I could lick you with\r\n",
      "one hand tied behind me, if I wanted to.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well why don’t you _do_ it? You _say_ you can do it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well I _will_, if you fool with me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh yes—I’ve seen whole families in the same fix.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Smarty! You think you’re _some_, now, _don’t_ you? Oh, what a hat!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You can lump that hat if you don’t like it. I dare you to knock it\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“You’re a liar!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You’re another.”\r\n",

      "“You’re a fighting liar and dasn’t take it up.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Aw—take a walk!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Say—if you give me much more of your sass I’ll take and bounce a rock\r\n",
      "off’n your head.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, of _course_ you will.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well I _will_.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well why don’t you _do_ it then? What do you keep _saying_ you will\r\n",
      "for? Why don’t you _do_ it? It’s because you’re afraid.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“You are.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another pause, and more eying and sidling around each other. Presently\r\n",
      "they were shoulder to shoulder. Tom said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Get away from here!”\r\n",

      "shoving with might and main, and glowering at each other with hate. But\r\n",
      "neither could get an advantage. After struggling till both were hot and\r\n",
      "flushed, each relaxed his strain with watchful caution, and Tom said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You’re a coward and a pup. I’ll tell my big brother on you, and he can\r\n",
      "thrash you with his little finger, and I’ll make him do it, too.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What do I care for your big brother? I’ve got a brother that’s bigger\r\n",

      "up. Anybody that’ll take a dare will steal sheep.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out\r\n",
      "with derision. Tom struck them to the ground. In an instant both boys\r\n",
      "were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats; and\r\n",
      "for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other’s hair and\r\n",
      "clothes, punched and scratched each other’s nose, and covered themselves\r\n",
      "with dust and glory. Presently the confusion took form, and through the\r\n",
      "fog of battle Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him\r\n",
      "with his fists. “Holler ’nuff!” said he.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "threatening what he would do to Tom the “next time he caught him out.”\r\n",
      " To which Tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and\r\n",
      "as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw it\r\n",
      "and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like\r\n",
      "an antelope. Tom chased the traitor home, and thus found out where he\r\n",
      "lived. He then held a position at the gate for some time, daring the\r\n",
      "enemy to come outside, but the enemy only made faces at him through the\r\n",
      "window and declined. At last the enemy’s mother appeared, and called Tom\r\n",
      "a bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away. So he went away; but\r\n",
      "he said he “’lowed” to “lay” for that boy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He got home pretty late that night, and when he climbed cautiously in\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "SATURDAY morning was come, and all the summer world was bright and\r\n",
      "fresh, and brimming with life. There was a song in every heart; and if\r\n",
      "the heart was young the music issued at the lips. There was cheer in\r\n",
      "every face and a spring in every step. The locust-trees were in bloom\r\n",
      "and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air. Cardiff Hill, beyond\r\n",
      "the village and above it, was green with vegetation and it lay just far\r\n",
      "enough away to seem a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a\r\n",
      "long-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and\r\n",
      "a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board\r\n",
      "fence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a\r\n",
      "burden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost\r\n",
      "plank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant\r\n",
      "whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed\r\n",
      "fence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged. Jim came skipping out at\r\n",
      "the gate with a tin pail, and singing Buffalo Gals. Bringing water from\r\n",
      "the town pump had always been hateful work in Tom’s eyes, before, but\r\n",
      "now it did not strike him so. He remembered that there was company at\r\n",
      "the pump. White, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there\r\n",
      "waiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling, fighting,\r\n",
      "skylarking. And he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred\r\n",
      "and fifty yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of water under an\r\n",
      "hour—and even then somebody generally had to go after him. Tom said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Say, Jim, I’ll fetch the water if you’ll whitewash some.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "talk don’t hurt—anyways it don’t if she don’t cry. Jim, I’ll give you a\r\n",
      "marvel. I’ll give you a white alley!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jim began to waver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“White alley, Jim! And it’s a bully taw.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“And besides, if you will I’ll show you my sore toe.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jim was only human—this attraction was too much for him. He put down\r\n",
      "his pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing\r\n",
      "interest while the bandage was being unwound. In another moment he\r\n",
      "was flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear, Tom was\r\n",
      "whitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring from the field with\r\n",
      "a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Tom’s energy did not last. He began to think of the fun he had\r\n",
      "planned for this day, and his sorrows multiplied. Soon the free boys\r\n",
      "would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions, and\r\n",
      "they would make a world of fun of him for having to work—the very\r\n",
      "thought of it burnt him like fire. He got out his worldly wealth and\r\n",
      "examined it—bits of toys, marbles, and trash; enough to buy an exchange\r\n",
      "of _work_, maybe, but not half enough to buy so much as half an hour\r\n",
      "of pure freedom. So he returned his straitened means to his pocket, and\r\n",
      "gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys. At this dark and hopeless\r\n",
      "moment an inspiration burst upon him! Nothing less than a great,\r\n",
      "magnificent inspiration.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He took up his brush and went tranquilly to work. Ben Rogers hove in\r\n",
      "sight presently—the very boy, of all boys, whose ridicule he had been\r\n",
      "dreading. Ben’s gait was the hop-skip-and-jump—proof enough that his\r\n",
      "heart was light and his anticipations high. He was eating an apple, and\r\n",
      "giving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned\r\n",
      "ding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating a steamboat. As\r\n",
      "he drew near, he slackened speed, took the middle of the street, leaned\r\n",
      "far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp\r\n",
      "and circumstance—for he was personating the Big Missouri, and considered\r\n",
      "himself to be drawing nine feet of water. He was boat and captain and\r\n",
      "engine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself standing on his own\r\n",
      "hurricane-deck giving the orders and executing them:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Stop her, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling!” The headway ran almost out, and he\r\n",
      "drew up slowly toward the sidewalk.\r\n",

      "representing a forty-foot wheel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "No answer. Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist, then\r\n",
      "he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as\r\n",
      "before. Ben ranged up alongside of him. Tom’s mouth watered for the\r\n",

      "“Hello, old chap, you got to work, hey?”\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "That put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his apple.\r\n",
      "Tom swept his brush daintily back and forth—stepped back to note the\r\n",
      "effect—added a touch here and there—criticised the effect again—Ben\r\n",
      "watching every move and getting more and more interested, more and more\r\n",
      "absorbed. Presently he said:\r\n",

      "particular about this fence—right here on the street, you know—but if it\r\n",
      "was the back fence I wouldn’t mind and _she_ wouldn’t. Yes, she’s awful\r\n",

      "Sid. Now don’t you see how I’m fixed? If you was to tackle this fence\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face, but alacrity in his\r\n",
      "heart. And while the late steamer Big Missouri worked and sweated in the\r\n",
      "sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by,\r\n",
      "dangled his legs, munched his apple, and planned the slaughter of more\r\n",
      "innocents. There was no lack of material; boys happened along every\r\n",
      "little while; they came to jeer, but remained to whitewash. By the time\r\n",
      "Ben was fagged out, Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for\r\n",
      "a kite, in good repair; and when he played out, Johnny Miller bought in\r\n",
      "for a dead rat and a string to swing it with—and so on, and so on, hour\r\n",
      "after hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, from being a\r\n",
      "poor poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling in\r\n",
      "wealth. He had besides the things before mentioned, twelve marbles, part\r\n",
      "of a jews-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through, a spool\r\n",
      "cannon, a key that wouldn’t unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a\r\n",
      "glass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles,\r\n",
      "six fire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass door-knob, a\r\n",
      "dog-collar—but no dog—the handle of a knife, four pieces of orange-peel,\r\n",
      "and a dilapidated old window sash.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had had a nice, good, idle time all the while—plenty of company—and\r\n",
      "the fence had three coats of whitewash on it! If he hadn’t run out of\r\n",
      "whitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all. He\r\n",
      "had discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it—namely,\r\n",
      "that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary\r\n",
      "to make the thing difficult to attain. If he had been a great and\r\n",
      "wise philosopher, like the writer of this book, he would now have\r\n",
      "comprehended that Work consists of whatever a body is _obliged_ to do,\r\n",
      "and that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do. And\r\n",
      "this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or\r\n",
      "performing on a tread-mill is work, while rolling ten-pins or climbing\r\n",
      "Mont Blanc is only amusement. There are wealthy gentlemen in England\r\n",
      "who drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a\r\n",
      "daily line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them considerable\r\n",
      "money; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would turn\r\n",
      "it into work and then they would resign.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place\r\n",
      "in his worldly circumstances, and then wended toward headquarters to\r\n",

      "CHAPTER III\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "TOM presented himself before Aunt Polly, who was sitting by an\r\n",
      "open window in a pleasant rearward apartment, which was bedroom,\r\n",
      "breakfast-room, dining-room, and library, combined. The balmy summer\r\n",
      "air, the restful quiet, the odor of the flowers, and the drowsing\r\n",
      "murmur of the bees had had their effect, and she was nodding over her\r\n",
      "knitting—for she had no company but the cat, and it was asleep in her\r\n",
      "lap. Her spectacles were propped up on her gray head for safety. She had\r\n",
      "thought that of course Tom had deserted long ago, and she wondered at\r\n",
      "seeing him place himself in her power again in this intrepid way. He\r\n",
      "said: “Mayn’t I go and play now, aunt?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What, a’ready? How much have you done?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s all done, aunt.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tom, don’t lie to me—I can’t bear it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I ain’t, aunt; it _is_ all done.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Aunt Polly placed small trust in such evidence. She went out to see for\r\n",
      "herself; and she would have been content to find twenty per cent. of\r\n",
      "Tom’s statement true. When she found the entire fence white-washed, and\r\n",
      "not only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated, and even a\r\n",
      "streak added to the ground, her astonishment was almost unspeakable. She\r\n",
      "said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, I never! There’s no getting round it, you can work when you’re a\r\n",
      "mind to, Tom.” And then she diluted the compliment by adding, “But it’s\r\n",
      "powerful seldom you’re a mind to, I’m bound to say. Well, go ’long and\r\n",
      "play; but mind you get back some time in a week, or I’ll tan you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took\r\n",
      "him into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him,\r\n",
      "along with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat\r\n",
      "took to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort.\r\n",
      "And while she closed with a happy Scriptural flourish, he “hooked” a\r\n",
      "doughnut.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then he skipped out, and saw Sid just starting up the outside stairway\r\n",
      "that led to the back rooms on the second floor. Clods were handy and\r\n",
      "the air was full of them in a twinkling. They raged around Sid like a\r\n",
      "hail-storm; and before Aunt Polly could collect her surprised faculties\r\n",
      "and sally to the rescue, six or seven clods had taken personal effect,\r\n",
      "and Tom was over the fence and gone. There was a gate, but as a general\r\n",
      "thing he was too crowded for time to make use of it. His soul was at\r\n",
      "peace, now that he had settled with Sid for calling attention to his\r\n",
      "black thread and getting him into trouble.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom skirted the block, and came round into a muddy alley that led by the\r\n",
      "back of his aunt’s cow-stable. He presently got safely beyond the reach\r\n",
      "of capture and punishment, and hastened toward the public square of the\r\n",
      "village, where two “military” companies of boys had met for conflict,\r\n",
      "according to previous appointment. Tom was General of one of these\r\n",
      "armies, Joe Harper (a bosom friend) General of the other. These two\r\n",
      "great commanders did not condescend to fight in person—that being better\r\n",
      "suited to the still smaller fry—but sat together on an eminence\r\n",
      "and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through\r\n",
      "aides-de-camp. Tom’s army won a great victory, after a long and\r\n",
      "hard-fought battle. Then the dead were counted, prisoners exchanged,\r\n",
      "the terms of the next disagreement agreed upon, and the day for the\r\n",
      "necessary battle appointed; after which the armies fell into line and\r\n",
      "marched away, and Tom turned homeward alone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived, he saw a new\r\n",
      "girl in the garden—a lovely little blue-eyed creature with yellow\r\n",
      "hair plaited into two long-tails, white summer frock and embroidered\r\n",
      "pan-talettes. The fresh-crowned hero fell without firing a shot. A\r\n",
      "certain Amy Lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a\r\n",
      "memory of herself behind. He had thought he loved her to distraction;\r\n",
      "he had regarded his passion as adoration; and behold it was only a poor\r\n",
      "little evanescent partiality. He had been months winning her; she had\r\n",
      "confessed hardly a week ago; he had been the happiest and the proudest\r\n",
      "boy in the world only seven short days, and here in one instant of time\r\n",
      "she had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is\r\n",
      "done.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He worshipped this new angel with furtive eye, till he saw that she had\r\n",
      "discovered him; then he pretended he did not know she was present, and\r\n",
      "began to “show off” in all sorts of absurd boyish ways, in order to win\r\n",
      "her admiration. He kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time;\r\n",
      "but by-and-by, while he was in the midst of some dangerous gymnastic\r\n",
      "performances, he glanced aside and saw that the little girl was wending\r\n",
      "her way toward the house. Tom came up to the fence and leaned on it,\r\n",
      "grieving, and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer. She halted a\r\n",
      "moment on the steps and then moved toward the door. Tom heaved a great\r\n",
      "sigh as she put her foot on the threshold. But his face lit up,\r\n",
      "right away, for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she\r\n",
      "disappeared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower, and\r\n",
      "then shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as\r\n",
      "if he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction.\r\n",
      "Presently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his\r\n",
      "nose, with his head tilted far back; and as he moved from side to side,\r\n",
      "in his efforts, he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy; finally his\r\n",
      "bare foot rested upon it, his pliant toes closed upon it, and he hopped\r\n",
      "away with the treasure and disappeared round the corner. But only for a\r\n",
      "minute—only while he could button the flower inside his jacket, next\r\n",
      "his heart—or next his stomach, possibly, for he was not much posted in\r\n",
      "anatomy, and not hypercritical, anyway.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He returned, now, and hung about the fence till nightfall, “showing\r\n",
      "off,” as before; but the girl never exhibited herself again, though Tom\r\n",
      "comforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near some\r\n",
      "window, meantime, and been aware of his attentions. Finally he strode\r\n",
      "home reluctantly, with his poor head full of visions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered “what\r\n",
      "had got into the child.” He took a good scolding about clodding Sid, and\r\n",
      "did not seem to mind it in the least. He tried to steal sugar under his\r\n",
      "aunt’s very nose, and got his knuckles rapped for it. He said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Aunt, you don’t whack Sid when he takes it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, Sid don’t torment a body the way you do. You’d be always into\r\n",
      "that sugar if I warn’t watching you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Presently she stepped into the kitchen, and Sid, happy in his immunity,\r\n",
      "reached for the sugar-bowl—a sort of glorying over Tom which was\r\n",
      "wellnigh unbearable. But Sid’s fingers slipped and the bowl dropped and\r\n",
      "broke. Tom was in ecstasies. In such ecstasies that he even controlled\r\n",
      "his tongue and was silent. He said to himself that he would not speak a\r\n",
      "word, even when his aunt came in, but would sit perfectly still till she\r\n",
      "asked who did the mischief; and then he would tell, and there would be\r\n",
      "nothing so good in the world as to see that pet model “catch it.” He was\r\n",
      "so brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the old\r\n",
      "lady came back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of wrath\r\n",
      "from over her spectacles. He said to himself, “Now it’s coming!” And the\r\n",
      "next instant he was sprawling on the floor! The potent palm was uplifted\r\n",
      "to strike again when Tom cried out:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hold on, now, what ’er you belting _me_ for?—Sid broke it!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Aunt Polly paused, perplexed, and Tom looked for healing pity. But when\r\n",
      "she got her tongue again, she only said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Umf! Well, you didn’t get a lick amiss, I reckon. You been into some\r\n",
      "other audacious mischief when I wasn’t around, like enough.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then her conscience reproached her, and she yearned to say something\r\n",
      "kind and loving; but she judged that this would be construed into a\r\n",
      "confession that she had been in the wrong, and discipline forbade that.\r\n",
      "So she kept silence, and went about her affairs with a troubled heart.\r\n",
      "Tom sulked in a corner and exalted his woes. He knew that in her heart\r\n",
      "his aunt was on her knees to him, and he was morosely gratified by the\r\n",
      "consciousness of it. He would hang out no signals, he would take notice\r\n",
      "of none. He knew that a yearning glance fell upon him, now and then,\r\n",
      "through a film of tears, but he refused recognition of it. He pictured\r\n",
      "himself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching\r\n",
      "one little forgiving word, but he would turn his face to the wall, and\r\n",
      "die with that word unsaid. Ah, how would she feel then? And he pictured\r\n",
      "himself brought home from the river, dead, with his curls all wet, and\r\n",
      "his sore heart at rest. How she would throw herself upon him, and how\r\n",
      "her tears would fall like rain, and her lips pray God to give her back\r\n",
      "her boy and she would never, never abuse him any more! But he would\r\n",
      "lie there cold and white and make no sign—a poor little sufferer, whose\r\n",
      "griefs were at an end. He so worked upon his feelings with the pathos of\r\n",
      "these dreams, that he had to keep swallowing, he was so like to choke;\r\n",
      "and his eyes swam in a blur of water, which overflowed when he winked,\r\n",
      "and ran down and trickled from the end of his nose. And such a luxury to\r\n",
      "him was this petting of his sorrows, that he could not bear to have any\r\n",
      "worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it; it was too\r\n",
      "sacred for such contact; and so, presently, when his cousin Mary danced\r\n",
      "in, all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an age-long visit\r\n",
      "of one week to the country, he got up and moved in clouds and darkness\r\n",
      "out at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at the other.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boys, and sought desolate\r\n",
      "places that were in harmony with his spirit. A log raft in the river\r\n",
      "invited him, and he seated himself on its outer edge and contemplated\r\n",
      "the dreary vastness of the stream, wishing, the while, that he could\r\n",
      "only be drowned, all at once and unconsciously, without undergoing the\r\n",
      "uncomfortable routine devised by nature. Then he thought of his flower.\r\n",
      "He got it out, rumpled and wilted, and it mightily increased his dismal\r\n",
      "felicity. He wondered if she would pity him if she knew? Would she\r\n",
      "cry, and wish that she had a right to put her arms around his neck and\r\n",
      "comfort him? Or would she turn coldly away like all the hollow world?\r\n",
      "This picture brought such an agony of pleasurable suffering that he\r\n",
      "worked it over and over again in his mind and set it up in new and\r\n",
      "varied lights, till he wore it threadbare. At last he rose up sighing\r\n",
      "and departed in the darkness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "About half-past nine or ten o’clock he came along the deserted street to\r\n",
      "where the Adored Unknown lived; he paused a moment; no sound fell upon\r\n",
      "his listening ear; a candle was casting a dull glow upon the curtain\r\n",
      "of a second-story window. Was the sacred presence there? He climbed the\r\n",
      "fence, threaded his stealthy way through the plants, till he stood under\r\n",
      "that window; he looked up at it long, and with emotion; then he laid him\r\n",
      "down on the ground under it, disposing himself upon his back, with his\r\n",
      "hands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor wilted flower.\r\n",
      "And thus he would die—out in the cold world, with no shelter over his\r\n",
      "homeless head, no friendly hand to wipe the death-damps from his brow,\r\n",
      "no loving face to bend pityingly over him when the great agony came. And\r\n",
      "thus _she_ would see him when she looked out upon the glad morning, and\r\n",
      "oh! would she drop one little tear upon his poor, lifeless form, would\r\n",
      "she heave one little sigh to see a bright young life so rudely blighted,\r\n",
      "so untimely cut down?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The window went up, a maid-servant’s discordant voice profaned the holy\r\n",
      "calm, and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyr’s remains!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort. There was a whiz\r\n",
      "as of a missile in the air, mingled with the murmur of a curse, a sound\r\n",
      "as of shivering glass followed, and a small, vague form went over the\r\n",
      "fence and shot away in the gloom.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Not long after, as Tom, all undressed for bed, was surveying his\r\n",
      "drenched garments by the light of a tallow dip, Sid woke up; but if he\r\n",
      "had any dim idea of making any “references to allusions,” he thought\r\n",
      "better of it and held his peace, for there was danger in Tom’s eye.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "THE sun rose upon a tranquil world, and beamed down upon the peaceful\r\n",
      "village like a benediction. Breakfast over, Aunt Polly had family\r\n",
      "worship: it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid\r\n",
      "courses of Scriptural quotations, welded together with a thin mortar of\r\n",
      "originality; and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter of\r\n",
      "the Mosaic Law, as from Sinai.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Tom girded up his loins, so to speak, and went to work to “get\r\n",
      "his verses.” Sid had learned his lesson days before. Tom bent all his\r\n",
      "energies to the memorizing of five verses, and he chose part of the\r\n",
      "Sermon on the Mount, because he could find no verses that were shorter.\r\n",
      "At the end of half an hour Tom had a vague general idea of his lesson,\r\n",
      "but no more, for his mind was traversing the whole field of human\r\n",
      "thought, and his hands were busy with distracting recreations. Mary took\r\n",
      "his book to hear him recite, and he tried to find his way through the\r\n",
      "fog:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Blessed are the—a—a—”\r\n",

      "Mary?—what do you want to be so mean for?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, Tom, you poor thick-headed thing, I’m not teasing you. I wouldn’t\r\n",
      "do that. You must go and learn it again. Don’t you be discouraged, Tom,\r\n",
      "you’ll manage it—and if you do, I’ll give you something ever so nice.\r\n",
      "There, now, that’s a good boy.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All right! What is it, Mary, tell me what it is.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Never you mind, Tom. You know if I say it’s nice, it is nice.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You bet you that’s so, Mary. All right, I’ll tackle it again.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And he did “tackle it again”—and under the double pressure of curiosity\r\n",
      "and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he accomplished a\r\n",
      "shining success. Mary gave him a brand-new “Barlow” knife worth twelve\r\n",
      "and a half cents; and the convulsion of delight that swept his system\r\n",
      "shook him to his foundations. True, the knife would not cut anything,\r\n",
      "but it was a “sure-enough” Barlow, and there was inconceivable grandeur\r\n",
      "in that—though where the Western boys ever got the idea that such a\r\n",
      "weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing\r\n",
      "mystery and will always remain so, perhaps. Tom contrived to scarify the\r\n",
      "cupboard with it, and was arranging to begin on the bureau, when he was\r\n",
      "called off to dress for Sunday-school.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap, and he went\r\n",
      "outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there; then he\r\n",
      "dipped the soap in the water and laid it down; turned up his sleeves;\r\n",
      "poured out the water on the ground, gently, and then entered the kitchen\r\n",
      "and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door. But\r\n",
      "Mary removed the towel and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now ain’t you ashamed, Tom. You mustn’t be so bad. Water won’t hurt\r\n",
      "you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom was a trifle disconcerted. The basin was refilled, and this time he\r\n",
      "stood over it a little while, gathering resolution; took in a big breath\r\n",
      "and began. When he entered the kitchen presently, with both eyes shut\r\n",
      "and groping for the towel with his hands, an honorable testimony of\r\n",
      "suds and water was dripping from his face. But when he emerged from\r\n",
      "the towel, he was not yet satisfactory, for the clean territory stopped\r\n",
      "short at his chin and his jaws, like a mask; below and beyond this line\r\n",
      "there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in\r\n",
      "front and backward around his neck. Mary took him in hand, and when she\r\n",
      "was done with him he was a man and a brother, without distinction of\r\n",
      "color, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its short curls\r\n",
      "wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect. [He privately\r\n",
      "smoothed out the curls, with labor and difficulty, and plastered his\r\n",
      "hair close down to his head; for he held curls to be effeminate, and his\r\n",
      "own filled his life with bitterness.] Then Mary got out a suit of his\r\n",
      "clothing that had been used only on Sundays during two years—they were\r\n",
      "simply called his “other clothes”—and so by that we know the size of his\r\n",
      "wardrobe. The girl “put him to rights” after he had dressed himself;\r\n",
      "she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin, turned his vast shirt\r\n",
      "collar down over his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned him with\r\n",
      "his speckled straw hat. He now looked exceedingly improved and\r\n",
      "uncomfortable. He was fully as uncomfortable as he looked; for there\r\n",
      "was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him. He\r\n",
      "hoped that Mary would forget his shoes, but the hope was blighted; she\r\n",
      "coated them thoroughly with tallow, as was the custom, and brought\r\n",
      "them out. He lost his temper and said he was always being made to do\r\n",
      "everything he didn’t want to do. But Mary said, persuasively:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Please, Tom—that’s a good boy.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So he got into the shoes snarling. Mary was soon ready, and the three\r\n",
      "children set out for Sunday-school—a place that Tom hated with his whole\r\n",
      "heart; but Sid and Mary were fond of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sabbath-school hours were from nine to half-past ten; and then church\r\n",
      "service. Two of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily,\r\n",
      "and the other always remained too—for stronger reasons. The church’s\r\n",
      "high-backed, uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons;\r\n",
      "the edifice was but a small, plain affair, with a sort of pine board\r\n",
      "tree-box on top of it for a steeple. At the door Tom dropped back a step\r\n",
      "and accosted a Sunday-dressed comrade:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Say, Billy, got a yaller ticket?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What’ll you take for her?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What’ll you give?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Piece of lickrish and a fish-hook.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Less see ’em.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom exhibited. They were satisfactory, and the property changed hands.\r\n",
      "Then Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and some\r\n",
      "small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones. He waylaid other\r\n",
      "boys as they came, and went on buying tickets of various colors ten\r\n",
      "or fifteen minutes longer. He entered the church, now, with a swarm\r\n",
      "of clean and noisy boys and girls, proceeded to his seat and started\r\n",
      "a quarrel with the first boy that came handy. The teacher, a grave,\r\n",
      "elderly man, interfered; then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a\r\n",
      "boy’s hair in the next bench, and was absorbed in his book when the boy\r\n",
      "turned around; stuck a pin in another boy, presently, in order to hear\r\n",
      "him say “Ouch!” and got a new reprimand from his teacher. Tom’s whole\r\n",
      "class were of a pattern—restless, noisy, and troublesome. When they came\r\n",
      "to recite their lessons, not one of them knew his verses perfectly, but\r\n",
      "had to be prompted all along. However, they worried through, and each\r\n",
      "got his reward—in small blue tickets, each with a passage of Scripture\r\n",
      "on it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation. Ten\r\n",
      "blue tickets equalled a red one, and could be exchanged for it; ten red\r\n",
      "tickets equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow tickets the superintendent\r\n",
      "gave a very plainly bound Bible (worth forty cents in those easy\r\n",
      "times) to the pupil. How many of my readers would have the industry and\r\n",
      "application to memorize two thousand verses, even for a Dore Bible? And\r\n",
      "yet Mary had acquired two Bibles in this way—it was the patient work of\r\n",
      "two years—and a boy of German parentage had won four or five. He once\r\n",
      "recited three thousand verses without stopping; but the strain upon his\r\n",
      "mental faculties was too great, and he was little better than an idiot\r\n",
      "from that day forth—a grievous misfortune for the school, for on great\r\n",
      "occasions, before company, the superintendent (as Tom expressed it)\r\n",
      "had always made this boy come out and “spread himself.” Only the older\r\n",
      "pupils managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work\r\n",
      "long enough to get a Bible, and so the delivery of one of these prizes\r\n",
      "was a rare and noteworthy circumstance; the successful pupil was so\r\n",
      "great and conspicuous for that day that on the spot every scholar’s\r\n",
      "heart was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple\r\n",
      "of weeks. It is possible that Tom’s mental stomach had never really\r\n",
      "hungered for one of those prizes, but unquestionably his entire being\r\n",
      "had for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit, with\r\n",
      "a closed hymn-book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its\r\n",
      "leaves, and commanded attention. When a Sunday-school superintendent\r\n",
      "makes his customary little speech, a hymn-book in the hand is as\r\n",
      "necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer\r\n",
      "who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert—though\r\n",
      "why, is a mystery: for neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of music\r\n",
      "is ever referred to by the sufferer. This superintendent was a slim\r\n",
      "creature of thirty-five, with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair; he\r\n",
      "wore a stiff standing-collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears\r\n",
      "and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth—a\r\n",
      "fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead, and a turning of the\r\n",
      "whole body when a side view was required; his chin was propped on a\r\n",
      "spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank-note, and had\r\n",
      "fringed ends; his boot toes were turned sharply up, in the fashion\r\n",
      "of the day, like sleigh-runners—an effect patiently and laboriously\r\n",
      "produced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a\r\n",
      "wall for hours together. Mr. Walters was very earnest of mien, and very\r\n",
      "sincere and honest at heart; and he held sacred things and places\r\n",
      "in such reverence, and so separated them from worldly matters, that\r\n",
      "unconsciously to himself his Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar\r\n",
      "intonation which was wholly absent on week-days. He began after this\r\n",
      "fashion:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now, children, I want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as\r\n",
      "you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two. There—that\r\n",
      "is it. That is the way good little boys and girls should do. I see one\r\n",
      "little girl who is looking out of the window—I am afraid she thinks I\r\n",
      "am out there somewhere—perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech\r\n",
      "to the little birds. [Applausive titter.] I want to tell you how good it\r\n",
      "makes me feel to see so many bright, clean little faces assembled in a\r\n",
      "place like this, learning to do right and be good.” And so forth and so\r\n",
      "on. It is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration. It was of a\r\n",
      "pattern which does not vary, and so it is familiar to us all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights\r\n",
      "and other recreations among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings\r\n",
      "and whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even to the bases of\r\n",
      "isolated and incorruptible rocks like Sid and Mary. But now every sound\r\n",
      "ceased suddenly, with the subsidence of Mr. Walters’ voice, and the\r\n",
      "conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was\r\n",
      "more or less rare—the entrance of visitors: lawyer Thatcher, accompanied\r\n",
      "by a very feeble and aged man; a fine, portly, middle-aged gentleman\r\n",
      "with iron-gray hair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter’s\r\n",
      "wife. The lady was leading a child. Tom had been restless and full of\r\n",
      "chafings and repinings; conscience-smitten, too—he could not meet Amy\r\n",
      "Lawrence’s eye, he could not brook her loving gaze. But when he saw this\r\n",
      "small newcomer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment. The next\r\n",
      "moment he was “showing off” with all his might—cuffing boys, pulling\r\n",
      "hair, making faces—in a word, using every art that seemed likely to\r\n",
      "fascinate a girl and win her applause. His exaltation had but one\r\n",
      "alloy—the memory of his humiliation in this angel’s garden—and that\r\n",
      "record in sand was fast washing out, under the waves of happiness that\r\n",
      "were sweeping over it now.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The visitors were given the highest seat of honor, and as soon as Mr.\r\n",
      "Walters’ speech was finished, he introduced them to the school. The\r\n",
      "middle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage—no less a one\r\n",
      "than the county judge—altogether the most august creation these children\r\n",
      "had ever looked upon—and they wondered what kind of material he was made\r\n",
      "of—and they half wanted to hear him roar, and were half afraid he might,\r\n",
      "too. He was from Constantinople, twelve miles away—so he had travelled,\r\n",

      "court-house—which was said to have a tin roof. The awe which these\r\n",
      "reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the\r\n",
      "ranks of staring eyes. This was the great Judge Thatcher, brother of\r\n",
      "their own lawyer. Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward, to be familiar\r\n",

      "books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect authority\r\n",
      "delights in. The young lady teachers “showed off”—bending sweetly over\r\n",
      "pupils that were lately being boxed, lifting pretty warning fingers\r\n",
      "at bad little boys and patting good ones lovingly. The young gentlemen\r\n",
      "teachers “showed off” with small scoldings and other little displays of\r\n",
      "authority and fine attention to discipline—and most of the teachers, of\r\n",
      "both sexes, found business up at the library, by the pulpit; and it was\r\n",
      "business that frequently had to be done over again two or three times\r\n",
      "(with much seeming vexation). The little girls “showed off” in various\r\n",
      "ways, and the little boys “showed off” with such diligence that the air\r\n",
      "was thick with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings. And above it\r\n",
      "all the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "There was only one thing wanting to make Mr. Walters’ ecstasy complete,\r\n",
      "and that was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and exhibit a prodigy.\r\n",
      "Several pupils had a few yellow tickets, but none had enough—he had been\r\n",
      "around among the star pupils inquiring. He would have given worlds, now,\r\n",
      "to have that German lad back again with a sound mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And now at this moment, when hope was dead, Tom Sawyer came forward with\r\n",
      "nine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and demanded\r\n",
      "a Bible. This was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. Walters was not\r\n",
      "expecting an application from this source for the next ten years. But\r\n",
      "there was no getting around it—here were the certified checks, and they\r\n",
      "were good for their face. Tom was therefore elevated to a place with\r\n",
      "the Judge and the other elect, and the great news was announced from\r\n",
      "headquarters. It was the most stunning surprise of the decade, and\r\n",
      "so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the\r\n",
      "judicial one’s altitude, and the school had two marvels to gaze upon\r\n",
      "in place of one. The boys were all eaten up with envy—but those that\r\n",

      "that there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light,\r\n",
      "perhaps; it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two\r\n",

      "a furtive glance told her worlds—and then her heart broke, and she was\r\n",

      "have liked to fall down and worship him, if it were in the dark. The\r\n",

      "Sunday-school children distributed themselves about the house and\r\n",
      "occupied pews with their parents, so as to be under supervision. Aunt\r\n",

      "the mayor and his wife—for they had a mayor there, among other\r\n",

      "the Model Boy, Willie Mufferson, taking as heedful care of his mother as\r\n",
      "if she were cut glass. He always brought his mother to church, and was\r\n",
      "the pride of all the matrons. The boys all hated him, he was so\r\n",
      "good. And besides, he had been “thrown up to them” so much. His\r\n",
      "white handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind, as usual on\r\n",

      "The congregation being fully assembled, now, the bell rang once more,\r\n",
      "to warn laggards and stragglers, and then a solemn hush fell upon the\r\n",
      "church which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the\r\n",
      "choir in the gallery. The choir always tittered and whispered all\r\n",
      "through service. There was once a church choir that was not ill-bred,\r\n",

      "into details: it pleaded for the church, and the little children of the\r\n",

      "and the good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear\r\n",

      "grateful harvest of good. Amen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation sat down.\r\n",
      "The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer, he\r\n",
      "only endured it—if he even did that much. He was restive all through it;\r\n",
      "he kept tally of the details of the prayer, unconsciously—for he was not\r\n",
      "listening, but he knew the ground of old, and the clergyman’s regular\r\n",
      "route over it—and when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded,\r\n",
      "his ear detected it and his whole nature resented it; he considered\r\n",
      "additions unfair, and scoundrelly. In the midst of the prayer a fly had\r\n",
      "lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by\r\n",
      "calmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its head with its arms, and\r\n",
      "polishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with\r\n",
      "the body, and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view; scraping\r\n",
      "its wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they\r\n",
      "had been coat-tails; going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if\r\n",
      "it knew it was perfectly safe. As indeed it was; for as sorely as Tom’s\r\n",
      "hands itched to grab for it they did not dare—he believed his soul would\r\n",
      "be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the prayer was going\r\n",
      "on. But with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal\r\n",
      "forward; and the instant the “Amen” was out the fly was a prisoner of\r\n",
      "war. His aunt detected the act and made him let it go.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an\r\n",
      "argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod—and\r\n",
      "yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone and\r\n",
      "thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be hardly\r\n",
      "worth the saving. Tom counted the pages of the sermon; after church he\r\n",
      "always knew how many pages there had been, but he seldom knew anything\r\n",
      "else about the discourse. However, this time he was really interested\r\n",
      "for a little while. The minister made a grand and moving picture of the\r\n",
      "assembling together of the world’s hosts at the millennium when the lion\r\n",
      "and the lamb should lie down together and a little child should lead\r\n",
      "them. But the pathos, the lesson, the moral of the great spectacle\r\n",
      "were lost upon the boy; he only thought of the conspicuousness of the\r\n",
      "principal character before the on-looking nations; his face lit with the\r\n",
      "thought, and he said to himself that he wished he could be that child,\r\n",
      "if it was a tame lion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now he lapsed into suffering again, as the dry argument was resumed.\r\n",
      "Presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out. It was\r\n",
      "a large black beetle with formidable jaws—a “pinchbug,” he called it. It\r\n",
      "was in a percussion-cap box. The first thing the beetle did was to\r\n",
      "take him by the finger. A natural fillip followed, the beetle went\r\n",
      "floundering into the aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt finger went\r\n",
      "into the boy’s mouth. The beetle lay there working its helpless legs,\r\n",
      "unable to turn over. Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out\r\n",
      "of his reach. Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in\r\n",
      "the beetle, and they eyed it too. Presently a vagrant poodle dog came\r\n",
      "idling along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and the\r\n",
      "quiet, weary of captivity, sighing for change. He spied the beetle; the\r\n",
      "drooping tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the prize; walked around\r\n",
      "it; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it again; grew\r\n",
      "bolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly\r\n",
      "snatch at it, just missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy\r\n",
      "the diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws,\r\n",
      "and continued his experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent\r\n",
      "and absent-minded. His head nodded, and little by little his chin\r\n",
      "descended and touched the enemy, who seized it. There was a sharp yelp,\r\n",
      "a flirt of the poodle’s head, and the beetle fell a couple of yards\r\n",
      "away, and lit on its back once more. The neighboring spectators\r\n",
      "shook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went behind fans and\r\n",
      "hand-kerchiefs, and Tom was entirely happy. The dog looked foolish,\r\n",
      "and probably felt so; but there was resentment in his heart, too, and a\r\n",
      "craving for revenge. So he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on\r\n",
      "it again; jumping at it from every point of a circle, lighting with his\r\n",
      "fore-paws within an inch of the creature, making even closer snatches at\r\n",
      "it with his teeth, and jerking his head till his ears flapped again. But\r\n",
      "he grew tired once more, after a while; tried to amuse himself with a\r\n",
      "fly but found no relief; followed an ant around, with his nose close\r\n",
      "to the floor, and quickly wearied of that; yawned, sighed, forgot the\r\n",
      "beetle entirely, and sat down on it. Then there was a wild yelp of agony\r\n",
      "and the poodle went sailing up the aisle; the yelps continued, and so\r\n",
      "did the dog; he crossed the house in front of the altar; he flew\r\n",
      "down the other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored up the\r\n",
      "home-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till presently he was\r\n",
      "but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of\r\n",
      "light. At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course, and sprang\r\n",
      "into its master’s lap; he flung it out of the window, and the voice of\r\n",
      "distress quickly thinned away and died in the distance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating with\r\n",
      "suppressed laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead standstill.\r\n",
      "The discourse was resumed presently, but it went lame and halting, all\r\n",
      "possibility of impressiveness being at an end; for even the gravest\r\n",
      "sentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of\r\n",
      "unholy mirth, under cover of some remote pew-back, as if the poor parson\r\n",

      "the doctor tell about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or\r\n",
      "three weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger. So the boy eagerly\r\n",
      "drew his sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection.\r\n",
      "But now he did not know the necessary symptoms. However, it seemed\r\n",
      "well worth while to chance it, so he fell to groaning with considerable\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "worked well, and Tom began to groan again. Sid yawned, stretched, then\r\n",
      "brought himself up on his elbow with a snort, and began to stare at Tom.\r\n",
      "Tom went on groaning. Sid said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tom! Say, Tom!” [No response.] “Here, Tom! TOM! What is the matter,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, auntie, I’m—”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, auntie, my sore toe’s mortified!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little, then cried a\r\n",
      "little, then did both together. This restored her and she said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tom, what a turn you did give me. Now you shut up that nonsense and\r\n",
      "climb out of this.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe. The boy felt a\r\n",
      "little foolish, and he said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Aunt Polly, it _seemed_ mortified, and it hurt so I never minded my\r\n",
      "tooth at all.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Your tooth, indeed! What’s the matter with your tooth?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“One of them’s loose, and it aches perfectly awful.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There, there, now, don’t begin that groaning again. Open your mouth.\r\n",
      "Well—your tooth _is_ loose, but you’re not going to die about that.\r\n",
      "Mary, get me a silk thread, and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, please, auntie, don’t pull it out. It don’t hurt any more. I wish\r\n",
      "I may never stir if it does. Please don’t, auntie. I don’t want to stay\r\n",
      "home from school.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, you don’t, don’t you? So all this row was because you thought you’d\r\n",

      "and you seem to try every way you can to break my old heart with your\r\n",
      "outrageousness.” By this time the dental instruments were ready. The old\r\n",
      "lady made one end of the silk thread fast to Tom’s tooth with a loop\r\n",
      "and tied the other to the bedpost. Then she seized the chunk of fire and\r\n",

      "by the bedpost, now.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But all trials bring their compensations. As Tom wended to school after\r\n",

      "upper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and admirable\r\n",
      "way. He gathered quite a following of lads interested in the exhibition;\r\n",
      "and one that had cut his finger and had been a centre of fascination and\r\n",
      "homage up to this time, now found himself suddenly without an adherent,\r\n",

      "and vulgar and bad—and because all their children admired him so, and\r\n",
      "delighted in his forbidden society, and wished they dared to be like\r\n",

      "not to play with him. So he played with him every time he got a chance.\r\n",
      "Huckleberry was always dressed in the cast-off clothes of full-grown\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "go fishing or swimming when and where he chose, and stay as long as it\r\n",
      "suited him; nobody forbade him to fight; he could sit up as late as he\r\n",
      "pleased; he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring\r\n",
      "and the last to resume leather in the fall; he never had to wash, nor\r\n",
      "put on clean clothes; he could swear wonderfully. In a word, everything\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Thomas Sawyer, this is the most astounding confession I have ever\r\n",
      "listened to. No mere ferule will answer for this offence. Take off your\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy, but\r\n",
      "in reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe\r\n",
      "of his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good\r\n",
      "fortune. He sat down upon the end of the pine bench and the girl hitched\r\n",
      "herself away from him with a toss of her head. Nudges and winks and\r\n",
      "whispers traversed the room, but Tom sat still, with his arms upon the\r\n",
      "long, low desk before him, and seemed to study his book.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By and by attention ceased from him, and the accustomed school murmur\r\n",
      "rose upon the dull air once more. Presently the boy began to steal\r\n",
      "furtive glances at the girl. She observed it, “made a mouth” at him\r\n",
      "and gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute. When she\r\n",
      "cautiously faced around again, a peach lay before her. She thrust it\r\n",
      "away. Tom gently put it back. She thrust it away again, but with less\r\n",
      "animosity. Tom patiently returned it to its place. Then she let it\r\n",
      "remain. Tom scrawled on his slate, “Please take it—I got more.” The\r\n",
      "girl glanced at the words, but made no sign. Now the boy began to draw\r\n",
      "something on the slate, hiding his work with his left hand. For a time\r\n",
      "the girl refused to notice; but her human curiosity presently began\r\n",
      "to manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs. The boy worked on,\r\n",
      "apparently unconscious. The girl made a sort of non-committal attempt\r\n",
      "to see, but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it. At last she\r\n",
      "gave in and hesitatingly whispered:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let me see it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable ends\r\n",
      "to it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney. Then the girl’s\r\n",
      "interest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot everything\r\n",
      "else. When it was finished, she gazed a moment, then whispered:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s nice—make a man.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The artist erected a man in the front yard, that resembled a derrick. He\r\n",
      "could have stepped over the house; but the girl was not hypercritical;\r\n",
      "she was satisfied with the monster, and whispered:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s a beautiful man—now make me coming along.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom drew an hour-glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and armed\r\n",
      "the spreading fingers with a portentous fan. The girl said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s ever so nice—I wish I could draw.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s easy,” whispered Tom, “I’ll learn you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, will you? When?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“At noon. Do you go home to dinner?”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Yes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now Tom began to scrawl something on the slate, hiding the words from\r\n",
      "the girl. But she was not backward this time. She begged to see. Tom\r\n",
      "said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, it ain’t anything.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“You’ll tell.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No I won’t—deed and deed and double deed won’t.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You won’t tell anybody at all? Ever, as long as you live?”\r\n",

      "“Oh, _you_ don’t want to see!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now that you treat me so, I _will_ see.” And she put her small hand\r\n",
      "upon his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending to resist in\r\n",
      "earnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were\r\n",
      "revealed: “_I love you_.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, you bad thing!” And she hit his hand a smart rap, but reddened and\r\n",
      "looked pleased, nevertheless.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Just at this juncture the boy felt a slow, fateful grip closing on his\r\n",
      "ear, and a steady lifting impulse. In that wise he was borne across the\r\n",
      "house and deposited in his own seat, under a peppering fire of giggles\r\n",
      "from the whole school. Then the master stood over him during a few awful\r\n",
      "moments, and finally moved away to his throne without saying a word. But\r\n",
      "although Tom’s ear tingled, his heart was jubilant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As the school quieted down Tom made an honest effort to study, but\r\n",
      "the turmoil within him was too great. In turn he took his place in the\r\n",
      "reading class and made a botch of it; then in the geography class and\r\n",
      "turned lakes into mountains, mountains into rivers, and rivers into\r\n",
      "continents, till chaos was come again; then in the spelling class, and\r\n",
      "got “turned down,” by a succession of mere baby words, till he brought\r\n",
      "up at the foot and yielded up the pewter medal which he had worn with\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "THE harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book, the more his ideas\r\n",
      "wandered. So at last, with a sigh and a yawn, he gave it up. It seemed\r\n",
      "to him that the noon recess would never come. The air was utterly dead.\r\n",
      "There was not a breath stirring. It was the sleepiest of sleepy days.\r\n",
      "The drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed\r\n",
      "the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees. Away off in the\r\n",
      "flaming sunshine, Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green sides through a\r\n",
      "shimmering veil of heat, tinted with the purple of distance; a few birds\r\n",
      "floated on lazy wing high in the air; no other living thing was visible\r\n",
      "but some cows, and they were asleep. Tom’s heart ached to be free, or\r\n",
      "else to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time.\r\n",
      "His hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of\r\n",
      "gratitude that was prayer, though he did not know it. Then furtively\r\n",
      "the percussion-cap box came out. He released the tick and put him on\r\n",
      "the long flat desk. The creature probably glowed with a gratitude that\r\n",
      "amounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it was premature: for when\r\n",
      "he started thankfully to travel off, Tom turned him aside with a pin and\r\n",
      "made him take a new direction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom’s bosom friend sat next him, suffering just as Tom had been, and\r\n",
      "now he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in\r\n",
      "an instant. This bosom friend was Joe Harper. The two boys were sworn\r\n",
      "friends all the week, and embattled enemies on Saturdays. Joe took a\r\n",
      "pin out of his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner.\r\n",
      "The sport grew in interest momently. Soon Tom said that they were\r\n",
      "interfering with each other, and neither getting the fullest benefit\r\n",
      "of the tick. So he put Joe’s slate on the desk and drew a line down the\r\n",
      "middle of it from top to bottom.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now,” said he, “as long as he is on your side you can stir him up and\r\n",
      "I’ll let him alone; but if you let him get away and get on my side,\r\n",
      "you’re to leave him alone as long as I can keep him from crossing over.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All right, go ahead; start him up.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The tick escaped from Tom, presently, and crossed the equator. Joe\r\n",
      "harassed him awhile, and then he got away and crossed back again. This\r\n",
      "change of base occurred often. While one boy was worrying the tick with\r\n",
      "absorbing interest, the other would look on with interest as strong, the\r\n",
      "two heads bowed together over the slate, and the two souls dead to all\r\n",
      "things else. At last luck seemed to settle and abide with Joe. The\r\n",
      "tick tried this, that, and the other course, and got as excited and as\r\n",
      "anxious as the boys themselves, but time and again just as he would\r\n",
      "have victory in his very grasp, so to speak, and Tom’s fingers would\r\n",
      "be twitching to begin, Joe’s pin would deftly head him off, and keep\r\n",
      "possession. At last Tom could stand it no longer. The temptation was too\r\n",
      "strong. So he reached out and lent a hand with his pin. Joe was angry in\r\n",
      "a moment. Said he:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tom, you let him alone.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I only just want to stir him up a little, Joe.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, sir, it ain’t fair; you just let him alone.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Blame it, I ain’t going to stir him much.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let him alone, I tell you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I won’t!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You shall—he’s on my side of the line.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Look here, Joe Harper, whose is that tick?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t care whose tick he is—he’s on my side of the line, and you\r\n",
      "sha’n’t touch him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, I’ll just bet I will, though. He’s my tick and I’ll do what I\r\n",
      "blame please with him, or die!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A tremendous whack came down on Tom’s shoulders, and its duplicate on\r\n",
      "Joe’s; and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly from\r\n",
      "the two jackets and the whole school to enjoy it. The boys had been\r\n",
      "too absorbed to notice the hush that had stolen upon the school awhile\r\n",
      "before when the master came tiptoeing down the room and stood over them.\r\n",
      "He had contemplated a good part of the performance before he contributed\r\n",
      "his bit of variety to it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When school broke up at noon, Tom flew to Becky Thatcher, and whispered\r\n",
      "in her ear:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Put on your bonnet and let on you’re going home; and when you get to\r\n",
      "the corner, give the rest of ’em the slip, and turn down through the\r\n",
      "lane and come back. I’ll go the other way and come it over ’em the same\r\n",
      "way.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So the one went off with one group of scholars, and the other with\r\n",
      "another. In a little while the two met at the bottom of the lane, and\r\n",
      "when they reached the school they had it all to themselves. Then they\r\n",
      "sat together, with a slate before them, and Tom gave Becky the pencil\r\n",
      "and held her hand in his, guiding it, and so created another surprising\r\n",
      "house. When the interest in art began to wane, the two fell to talking.\r\n",
      "Tom was swimming in bliss. He said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you love rats?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No! I hate them!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, I do, too—_live_ ones. But I mean dead ones, to swing round your\r\n",
      "head with a string.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, I don’t care for rats much, anyway. What I like is chewing-gum.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, I should say so! I wish I had some now.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you? I’ve got some. I’ll let you chew it awhile, but you must give\r\n",
      "it back to me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That was agreeable, so they chewed it turn about, and dangled their legs\r\n",
      "against the bench in excess of contentment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Was you ever at a circus?” said Tom.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, and my pa’s going to take me again some time, if I’m good.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I been to the circus three or four times—lots of times. Church ain’t\r\n",

      "all. Anybody can do it.”\r\n",

      "“Now, Becky, it’s all done—all over but the kiss. Don’t you be afraid\r\n",
      "of that—it ain’t anything at all. Please, Becky.” And he tugged at her\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "TOM dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well out of the\r\n",
      "track of returning scholars, and then fell into a moody jog. He crossed\r\n",
      "a small “branch” two or three times, because of a prevailing juvenile\r\n",
      "superstition that to cross water baffled pursuit. Half an hour later\r\n",
      "he was disappearing behind the Douglas mansion on the summit of Cardiff\r\n",
      "Hill, and the school-house was hardly distinguishable away off in the\r\n",
      "valley behind him. He entered a dense wood, picked his pathless way to\r\n",
      "the centre of it, and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading oak.\r\n",
      "There was not even a zephyr stirring; the dead noonday heat had even\r\n",
      "stilled the songs of the birds; nature lay in a trance that was broken\r\n",
      "by no sound but the occasional far-off hammering of a wood-pecker, and\r\n",
      "this seemed to render the pervading silence and sense of loneliness the\r\n",
      "more profound. The boy’s soul was steeped in melancholy; his feelings\r\n",
      "were in happy accord with his surroundings. He sat long with his elbows\r\n",
      "on his knees and his chin in his hands, meditating. It seemed to him\r\n",
      "that life was but a trouble, at best, and he more than half envied Jimmy\r\n",
      "Hodges, so lately released; it must be very peaceful, he thought, to lie\r\n",
      "and slumber and dream forever and ever, with the wind whispering through\r\n",
      "the trees and caressing the grass and the flowers over the grave, and\r\n",
      "nothing to bother and grieve about, ever any more. If he only had a\r\n",
      "clean Sunday-school record he could be willing to go, and be done with\r\n",
      "it all. Now as to this girl. What had he done? Nothing. He had meant\r\n",
      "the best in the world, and been treated like a dog—like a very dog. She\r\n",
      "would be sorry some day—maybe when it was too late. Ah, if he could only\r\n",
      "die _temporarily_!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one constrained\r\n",
      "shape long at a time. Tom presently began to drift insensibly back into\r\n",
      "the concerns of this life again. What if he turned his back, now, and\r\n",
      "disappeared mysteriously? What if he went away—ever so far away, into\r\n",
      "unknown countries beyond the seas—and never came back any more! How\r\n",
      "would she feel then! The idea of being a clown recurred to him now, only\r\n",
      "to fill him with disgust. For frivolity and jokes and spotted tights\r\n",
      "were an offense, when they intruded themselves upon a spirit that was\r\n",
      "exalted into the vague august realm of the romantic. No, he would be\r\n",
      "a soldier, and return after long years, all war-worn and illustrious.\r\n",
      "No—better still, he would join the Indians, and hunt buffaloes and go on\r\n",
      "the warpath in the mountain ranges and the trackless great plains of the\r\n",
      "Far West, and away in the future come back a great chief, bristling with\r\n",
      "feathers, hideous with paint, and prance into Sunday-school, some drowsy\r\n",
      "summer morning, with a blood-curdling war-whoop, and sear the eyeballs\r\n",
      "of all his companions with unappeasable envy. But no, there was\r\n",
      "something gaudier even than this. He would be a pirate! That was it!\r\n",
      "_now_ his future lay plain before him, and glowing with unimaginable\r\n",
      "splendor. How his name would fill the world, and make people shudder!\r\n",
      "How gloriously he would go plowing the dancing seas, in his long, low,\r\n",
      "black-hulled racer, the Spirit of the Storm, with his grisly flag flying\r\n",
      "at the fore! And at the zenith of his fame, how he would suddenly appear\r\n",
      "at the old village and stalk into church, brown and weather-beaten, in\r\n",
      "his black velvet doublet and trunks, his great jack-boots, his crimson\r\n",
      "sash, his belt bristling with horse-pistols, his crime-rusted cutlass\r\n",
      "at his side, his slouch hat with waving plumes, his black flag unfurled,\r\n",
      "with the skull and crossbones on it, and hear with swelling ecstasy\r\n",
      "the whisperings, “It’s Tom Sawyer the Pirate!—the Black Avenger of the\r\n",
      "Spanish Main!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yes, it was settled; his career was determined. He would run away from\r\n",
      "home and enter upon it. He would start the very next morning. Therefore\r\n",
      "he must now begin to get ready. He would collect his resources together.\r\n",
      "He went to a rotten log near at hand and began to dig under one end of\r\n",
      "it with his Barlow knife. He soon struck wood that sounded hollow. He\r\n",
      "put his hand there and uttered this incantation impressively:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What hasn’t come here, come! What’s here, stay here!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then he scraped away the dirt, and exposed a pine shingle. He took it\r\n",
      "up and disclosed a shapely little treasure-house whose bottom and sides\r\n",
      "were of shingles. In it lay a marble. Tom’s astonishment was bound-less!\r\n",
      "He scratched his head with a perplexed air, and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, that beats anything!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then he tossed the marble away pettishly, and stood cogitating. The\r\n",
      "truth was, that a superstition of his had failed, here, which he and\r\n",
      "all his comrades had always looked upon as infallible. If you buried\r\n",
      "a marble with certain necessary incantations, and left it alone a\r\n",
      "fortnight, and then opened the place with the incantation he had just\r\n",
      "used, you would find that all the marbles you had ever lost had gathered\r\n",
      "themselves together there, meantime, no matter how widely they had been\r\n",
      "separated. But now, this thing had actually and unquestionably failed.\r\n",
      "Tom’s whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations. He had\r\n",
      "many a time heard of this thing succeeding but never of its failing\r\n",
      "before. It did not occur to him that he had tried it several times\r\n",
      "before, himself, but could never find the hiding-places afterward. He\r\n",
      "puzzled over the matter some time, and finally decided that some witch\r\n",
      "had interfered and broken the charm. He thought he would satisfy himself\r\n",
      "on that point; so he searched around till he found a small sandy spot\r\n",
      "with a little funnel-shaped depression in it. He laid himself down and\r\n",
      "put his mouth close to this depression and called—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know! Doodle-bug,\r\n",
      "doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The sand began to work, and presently a small black bug appeared for a\r\n",
      "second and then darted under again in a fright.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He dasn’t tell! So it _was_ a witch that done it. I just knowed it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches, so he\r\n",
      "gave up discouraged. But it occurred to him that he might as well have\r\n",
      "the marble he had just thrown away, and therefore he went and made a\r\n",
      "patient search for it. But he could not find it. Now he went back to his\r\n",
      "treasure-house and carefully placed himself just as he had been standing\r\n",
      "when he tossed the marble away; then he took another marble from his\r\n",
      "pocket and tossed it in the same way, saying:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Brother, go find your brother!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He watched where it stopped, and went there and looked. But it must\r\n",
      "have fallen short or gone too far; so he tried twice more. The last\r\n",
      "repetition was successful. The two marbles lay within a foot of each\r\n",
      "other.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Just here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the green\r\n",
      "aisles of the forest. Tom flung off his jacket and trousers, turned\r\n",
      "a suspender into a belt, raked away some brush behind the rotten log,\r\n",
      "disclosing a rude bow and arrow, a lath sword and a tin trumpet, and\r\n",
      "in a moment had seized these things and bounded away, barelegged,\r\n",
      "with fluttering shirt. He presently halted under a great elm, blew an\r\n",
      "answering blast, and then began to tiptoe and look warily out, this way\r\n",
      "and that. He said cautiously—to an imaginary company:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hold, my merry men! Keep hid till I blow.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now appeared Joe Harper, as airily clad and elaborately armed as Tom.\r\n",
      "Tom called:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hold! Who comes here into Sherwood Forest without my pass?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Guy of Guisborne wants no man’s pass. Who art thou that—that—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dares to hold such language,” said Tom, prompting—for they talked “by\r\n",
      "the book,” from memory.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who art thou that dares to hold such language?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I, indeed! I am Robin Hood, as thy caitiff carcase soon shall know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then art thou indeed that famous outlaw? Right gladly will I dispute\r\n",
      "with thee the passes of the merry wood. Have at thee!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They took their lath swords, dumped their other traps on the ground,\r\n",
      "struck a fencing attitude, foot to foot, and began a grave, careful\r\n",
      "combat, “two up and two down.” Presently Tom said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now, if you’ve got the hang, go it lively!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So they “went it lively,” panting and perspiring with the work. By and\r\n",
      "by Tom shouted:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Fall! fall! Why don’t you fall?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I sha’n’t! Why don’t you fall yourself? You’re getting the worst of\r\n",
      "it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, that ain’t anything. I can’t fall; that ain’t the way it is in the\r\n",
      "book. The book says, ‘Then with one back-handed stroke he slew poor Guy\r\n",
      "of Guisborne.’ You’re to turn around and let me hit you in the back.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was no getting around the authorities, so Joe turned, received the\r\n",
      "whack and fell.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now,” said Joe, getting up, “you got to let me kill _you_. That’s\r\n",
      "fair.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, I can’t do that, it ain’t in the book.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, it’s blamed mean—that’s all.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, say, Joe, you can be Friar Tuck or Much the miller’s son, and lam\r\n",

      "Robin Hood a little while and kill me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was satisfactory, and so these adventures were carried out. Then\r\n",
      "Tom became Robin Hood again, and was allowed by the treacherous nun to\r\n",
      "bleed his strength away through his neglected wound. And at last Joe,\r\n",
      "representing a whole tribe of weeping outlaws, dragged him sadly forth,\r\n",
      "gave his bow into his feeble hands, and Tom said, “Where this arrow\r\n",
      "falls, there bury poor Robin Hood under the greenwood tree.” Then he\r\n",
      "shot the arrow and fell back and would have died, but he lit on a nettle\r\n",
      "and sprang up too gaily for a corpse.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The boys dressed themselves, hid their accoutrements, and went off\r\n",
      "grieving that there were no outlaws any more, and wondering what modern\r\n",
      "civilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss.\r\n",

      "AT half-past nine, that night, Tom and Sid were sent to bed, as usual.\r\n",
      "They said their prayers, and Sid was soon asleep. Tom lay awake and\r\n",
      "waited, in restless impatience. When it seemed to him that it must be\r\n",
      "nearly daylight, he heard the clock strike ten! This was despair. He\r\n",
      "would have tossed and fidgeted, as his nerves demanded, but he was\r\n",
      "afraid he might wake Sid. So he lay still, and stared up into the dark.\r\n",
      "Everything was dismally still. By and by, out of the stillness, little,\r\n",
      "scarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves. The ticking\r\n",
      "of the clock began to bring itself into notice. Old beams began to crack\r\n",
      "mysteriously. The stairs creaked faintly. Evidently spirits were abroad.\r\n",
      "A measured, muffled snore issued from Aunt Polly’s chamber. And now the\r\n",
      "tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate,\r\n",
      "began. Next the ghastly ticking of a death-watch in the wall at the\r\n",
      "bed’s head made Tom shudder—it meant that somebody’s days were numbered.\r\n",
      "Then the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night air, and was answered\r\n",
      "by a fainter howl from a remoter distance. Tom was in an agony. At last\r\n",
      "he was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun; he began to\r\n",
      "doze, in spite of himself; the clock chimed eleven, but he did not hear\r\n",
      "it. And then there came, mingling with his half-formed dreams, a most\r\n",
      "melancholy caterwauling. The raising of a neighboring window disturbed\r\n",
      "him. A cry of “Scat! you devil!” and the crash of an empty bottle\r\n",
      "against the back of his aunt’s woodshed brought him wide awake, and a\r\n",
      "single minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping\r\n",
      "along the roof of the “ell” on all fours. He “meow’d” with caution once\r\n",
      "or twice, as he went; then jumped to the roof of the woodshed and thence\r\n",
      "to the ground. Huckleberry Finn was there, with his dead cat. The boys\r\n",
      "moved off and disappeared in the gloom. At the end of half an hour they\r\n",
      "were wading through the tall grass of the graveyard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a graveyard of the old-fashioned Western kind. It was on a hill,\r\n",
      "about a mile and a half from the village. It had a crazy board fence\r\n",
      "around it, which leaned inward in places, and outward the rest of the\r\n",
      "time, but stood upright nowhere. Grass and weeds grew rank over the\r\n",
      "whole cemetery. All the old graves were sunken in, there was not a\r\n",
      "tombstone on the place; round-topped, worm-eaten boards staggered over\r\n",
      "the graves, leaning for support and finding none. “Sacred to the memory\r\n",
      "of” So-and-So had been painted on them once, but it could no longer have\r\n",
      "been read, on the most of them, now, even if there had been light.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A faint wind moaned through the trees, and Tom feared it might be the\r\n",
      "spirits of the dead, complaining at being disturbed. The boys talked\r\n",
      "little, and only under their breath, for the time and the place and the\r\n",
      "pervading solemnity and silence oppressed their spirits. They found the\r\n",
      "sharp new heap they were seeking, and ensconced themselves within the\r\n",
      "protection of three great elms that grew in a bunch within a few feet of\r\n",
      "the grave.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then they waited in silence for what seemed a long time. The hooting of\r\n",
      "a distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead stillness. Tom’s\r\n",
      "reflections grew oppressive. He must force some talk. So he said in a\r\n",
      "whisper:\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "“I wisht I knowed. It’s awful solemn like, _ain’t_ it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "There was a considerable pause, while the boys canvassed this matter\r\n",

      "“Say, Hucky—do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us talking?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“O’ course he does. Least his sperrit does.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, don’t be afeard. I don’t believe they’ll bother us. We ain’t doing\r\n",

      "“I bet I know it. Don’t you stir nor budge. He ain’t sharp enough to\r\n",
      "notice us. Drunk, the same as usual, likely—blamed old rip!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All right, I’ll keep still. Now they’re stuck. Can’t find it. Here they\r\n",
      "come again. Now they’re hot. Cold again. Hot again. Red hot! They’re\r\n",
      "p’inted right, this time. Say, Huck, I know another o’ them voices; it’s\r\n",
      "Injun Joe.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The whisper died wholly out, now, for the three men had reached the\r\n",
      "grave and stood within a few feet of the boys’ hiding-place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Here it is,” said the third voice; and the owner of it held the lantern\r\n",
      "up and revealed the face of young Doctor Robinson.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Potter and Injun Joe were carrying a handbarrow with a rope and a couple\r\n",
      "of shovels on it. They cast down their load and began to open the grave.\r\n",
      "The doctor put the lantern at the head of the grave and came and sat\r\n",
      "down with his back against one of the elm trees. He was so close the\r\n",
      "boys could have touched him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hurry, men!” he said, in a low voice; “the moon might come out at any\r\n",
      "moment.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They growled a response and went on digging. For some time there was no\r\n",
      "noise but the grating sound of the spades discharging their freight of\r\n",
      "mould and gravel. It was very monotonous. Finally a spade struck upon\r\n",
      "the coffin with a dull woody accent, and within another minute or two\r\n",
      "the men had hoisted it out on the ground. They pried off the lid with\r\n",
      "their shovels, got out the body and dumped it rudely on the ground. The\r\n",
      "moon drifted from behind the clouds and exposed the pallid face.\r\n",
      "The barrow was got ready and the corpse placed on it, covered with a\r\n",
      "blanket, and bound to its place with the rope. Potter took out a large\r\n",
      "spring-knife and cut off the dangling end of the rope and then said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now the cussed thing’s ready, Sawbones, and you’ll just out with\r\n",
      "another five, or here she stays.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s the talk!” said Injun Joe.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Look here, what does this mean?” said the doctor. “You required your\r\n",
      "pay in advance, and I’ve paid you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, and you done more than that,” said Injun Joe, approaching the\r\n",
      "doctor, who was now standing. “Five years ago you drove me away from\r\n",
      "your father’s kitchen one night, when I come to ask for something to\r\n",
      "eat, and you said I warn’t there for any good; and when I swore I’d get\r\n",
      "even with you if it took a hundred years, your father had me jailed for\r\n",
      "a vagrant. Did you think I’d forget? The Injun blood ain’t in me for\r\n",
      "nothing. And now I’ve _got_ you, and you got to _settle_, you know!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was threatening the doctor, with his fist in his face, by this time.\r\n",
      "The doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian on the ground.\r\n",
      "Potter dropped his knife, and exclaimed:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Here, now, don’t you hit my pard!” and the next moment he had grappled\r\n",
      "with the doctor and the two were struggling with might and main,\r\n",
      "trampling the grass and tearing the ground with their heels. Injun Joe\r\n",
      "sprang to his feet, his eyes flaming with passion, snatched up Potter’s\r\n",
      "knife, and went creeping, catlike and stooping, round and round about\r\n",
      "the combatants, seeking an opportunity. All at once the doctor flung\r\n",
      "himself free, seized the heavy headboard of Williams’ grave and felled\r\n",
      "Potter to the earth with it—and in the same instant the half-breed saw\r\n",
      "his chance and drove the knife to the hilt in the young man’s breast. He\r\n",
      "reeled and fell partly upon Potter, flooding him with his blood, and in\r\n",
      "the same moment the clouds blotted out the dreadful spectacle and the\r\n",
      "two frightened boys went speeding away in the dark.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Presently, when the moon emerged again, Injun Joe was standing over the\r\n",
      "two forms, contemplating them. The doctor murmured inarticulately, gave\r\n",
      "a long gasp or two and was still. The half-breed muttered:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“_That_ score is settled—damn you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then he robbed the body. After which he put the fatal knife in Potter’s\r\n",
      "open right hand, and sat down on the dismantled coffin. Three—four—five\r\n",
      "minutes passed, and then Potter began to stir and moan. His hand closed\r\n",
      "upon the knife; he raised it, glanced at it, and let it fall, with a\r\n",
      "shudder. Then he sat up, pushing the body from him, and gazed at it, and\r\n",
      "then around him, confusedly. His eyes met Joe’s.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Lord, how is this, Joe?” he said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s a dirty business,” said Joe, without moving.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What did you do it for?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I! I never done it!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Look here! That kind of talk won’t wash.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Potter trembled and grew white.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I thought I’d got sober. I’d no business to drink to-night. But it’s\r\n",
      "in my head yet—worse’n when we started here. I’m all in a muddle;\r\n",
      "can’t recollect anything of it, hardly. Tell me, Joe—_honest_, now,\r\n",
      "old feller—did I do it? Joe, I never meant to—’pon my soul and honor, I\r\n",
      "never meant to, Joe. Tell me how it was, Joe. Oh, it’s awful—and him so\r\n",
      "young and promising.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, you two was scuffling, and he fetched you one with the headboard\r\n",
      "and you fell flat; and then up you come, all reeling and staggering\r\n",
      "like, and snatched the knife and jammed it into him, just as he fetched\r\n",

      "now.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, I didn’t know what I was a-doing. I wish I may die this minute if I\r\n",
      "did. It was all on account of the whiskey and the excitement, I reckon.\r\n",
      "I never used a weepon in my life before, Joe. I’ve fought, but never\r\n",
      "with weepons. They’ll all say that. Joe, don’t tell! Say you won’t tell,\r\n",
      "Joe—that’s a good feller. I always liked you, Joe, and stood up for you,\r\n",
      "too. Don’t you remember? You _won’t_ tell, _will_ you, Joe?” And the\r\n",
      "poor creature dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer, and\r\n",
      "clasped his appealing hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, you’ve always been fair and square with me, Muff Potter, and I\r\n",
      "won’t go back on you. There, now, that’s as fair as a man can say.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, Joe, you’re an angel. I’ll bless you for this the longest day I\r\n",
      "live.” And Potter began to cry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come, now, that’s enough of that. This ain’t any time for blubbering.\r\n",
      "You be off yonder way and I’ll go this. Move, now, and don’t leave any\r\n",
      "tracks behind you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Potter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run. The half-breed\r\n",
      "stood looking after him. He muttered:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If he’s as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he\r\n",
      "had the look of being, he won’t think of the knife till he’s gone so\r\n",
      "far he’ll be afraid to come back after it to such a place by\r\n",
      "himself—chicken-heart!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Two or three minutes later the murdered man, the blanketed corpse, the\r\n",
      "lidless coffin, and the open grave were under no inspection but the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "THE two boys flew on and on, toward the village, speechless with\r\n",
      "horror. They glanced backward over their shoulders from time to time,\r\n",
      "apprehensively, as if they feared they might be followed. Every stump\r\n",
      "that started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy, and made them\r\n",
      "catch their breath; and as they sped by some outlying cottages that lay\r\n",
      "near the village, the barking of the aroused watch-dogs seemed to give\r\n",
      "wings to their feet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If we can only get to the old tannery before we break down!” whispered\r\n",
      "Tom, in short catches between breaths. “I can’t stand it much longer.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Huckleberry’s hard pantings were his only reply, and the boys fixed\r\n",
      "their eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work to win it.\r\n",
      "They gained steadily on it, and at last, breast to breast, they burst\r\n",
      "through the open door and fell grateful and exhausted in the sheltering\r\n",
      "shadows beyond. By and by their pulses slowed down, and Tom whispered:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Huckleberry, what do you reckon’ll come of this?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If Doctor Robinson dies, I reckon hanging’ll come of it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you though?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, I _know_ it, Tom.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom thought a while, then he said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who’ll tell? We?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What are you talking about? S’pose something happened and Injun Joe\r\n",
      "_didn’t_ hang? Why, he’d kill us some time or other, just as dead sure\r\n",
      "as we’re a laying here.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s just what I was thinking to myself, Huck.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If anybody tells, let Muff Potter do it, if he’s fool enough. He’s\r\n",
      "generally drunk enough.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom said nothing—went on thinking. Presently he whispered:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Huck, Muff Potter don’t know it. How can he tell?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What’s the reason he don’t know it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Because he’d just got that whack when Injun Joe done it. D’you reckon\r\n",
      "he could see anything? D’you reckon he knowed anything?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“By hokey, that’s so, Tom!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And besides, look-a-here—maybe that whack done for _him_!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, ’taint likely, Tom. He had liquor in him; I could see that; and\r\n",
      "besides, he always has. Well, when pap’s full, you might take and belt\r\n",
      "him over the head with a church and you couldn’t phase him. He says so,\r\n",
      "his own self. So it’s the same with Muff Potter, of course. But if a man\r\n",
      "was dead sober, I reckon maybe that whack might fetch him; I dono.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After another reflective silence, Tom said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hucky, you sure you can keep mum?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tom, we _got_ to keep mum. You know that. That Injun devil wouldn’t\r\n",
      "make any more of drownding us than a couple of cats, if we was to squeak\r\n",
      "’bout this and they didn’t hang him. Now, look-a-here, Tom, less take\r\n",
      "and swear to one another—that’s what we got to do—swear to keep mum.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’m agreed. It’s the best thing. Would you just hold hands and swear\r\n",
      "that we—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh no, that wouldn’t do for this. That’s good enough for little\r\n",
      "rubbishy common things—specially with gals, cuz _they_ go back on you\r\n",
      "anyway, and blab if they get in a huff—but there orter be writing ’bout\r\n",
      "a big thing like this. And blood.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom’s whole being applauded this idea. It was deep, and dark, and awful;\r\n",
      "the hour, the circumstances, the surroundings, were in keeping with it.\r\n",
      "He picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moon-light, took a\r\n",
      "little fragment of “red keel” out of his pocket, got the moon on\r\n",
      "his work, and painfully scrawled these lines, emphasizing each slow\r\n",
      "down-stroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth, and letting up the\r\n",
      "pressure on the up-strokes. [See next page.]\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer swears they will keep mum about This and They\r\n",
      "wish They may Drop down dead in Their Tracks if They ever Tell and Rot.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Huckleberry was filled with admiration of Tom’s facility in writing, and\r\n",
      "the sublimity of his language. He at once took a pin from his lapel and\r\n",
      "was going to prick his flesh, but Tom said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hold on! Don’t do that. A pin’s brass. It might have verdigrease on\r\n",
      "it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What’s verdigrease?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s p’ison. That’s what it is. You just swaller some of it once—you’ll\r\n",
      "see.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So Tom unwound the thread from one of his needles, and each boy pricked\r\n",
      "the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood. In time, after\r\n",
      "many squeezes, Tom managed to sign his initials, using the ball of his\r\n",
      "little finger for a pen. Then he showed Huckleberry how to make an H and\r\n",
      "an F, and the oath was complete. They buried the shingle close to the\r\n",
      "wall, with some dismal ceremonies and incantations, and the fetters\r\n",
      "that bound their tongues were considered to be locked and the key thrown\r\n",
      "away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the ruined\r\n",
      "building, now, but they did not notice it.\r\n",

      "“Tom,” whispered Huckleberry, “does this keep us from _ever_\r\n",
      "telling—_always_?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Of course it does. It don’t make any difference _what_ happens, we got\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I reckon that’s so.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They continued to whisper for some little time. Presently a dog set up\r\n",
      "a long, lugubrious howl just outside—within ten feet of them. The boys\r\n",
      "clasped each other suddenly, in an agony of fright.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Which of us does he mean?” gasped Huckleberry.\r\n",

      "“Please, Tom. There ’tis again!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, lordy, I’m thankful!” whispered Tom. “I know his voice. It’s Bull\r\n",
      "Harbison.” *\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "[* If Mr. Harbison owned a slave named Bull, Tom would have spoken of\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "anything it was a _stray_ dog.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The dog howled again. The boys’ hearts sank once more.\r\n",

      "Tom!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom, quaking with fear, yielded, and put his eye to the crack. His\r\n",

      "tried—but no, I wouldn’t, of course. But if ever I get off this time,\r\n",
      "I lay I’ll just _waller_ in Sunday-schools!” And Tom began to snuffle a\r\n",

      "The howling stopped. Tom pricked up his ears.\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "this town any more.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "the one behind the other. When they had got to within five steps of the\r\n",
      "snorer, Tom stepped on a stick, and it broke with a sharp snap. The man\r\n",

      "Muff Potter. The boys’ hearts had stood still, and their hopes too,\r\n",
      "when the man moved, but their fears passed away now. They tip-toed out,\r\n",
      "through the broken weather-boarding, and stopped at a little distance\r\n",
      "to exchange a parting word. That long, lugubrious howl rose on the night\r\n",
      "air again! They turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few\r\n",
      "feet of where Potter was lying, and _facing_ Potter, with his nose\r\n",
      "pointing heavenward.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, geeminy, it’s _him_!” exclaimed both boys, in a breath.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Say, Tom—they say a stray dog come howling around Johnny Miller’s\r\n",
      "house, ’bout midnight, as much as two weeks ago; and a whippoorwill come\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Well, I know that. And suppose there ain’t. Didn’t Gracie Miller fall\r\n",

      "Then they separated, cogitating. When Tom crept in at his bedroom window\r\n",
      "the night was almost spent. He undressed with excessive caution, and\r\n",
      "fell asleep congratulating himself that nobody knew of his escapade. He\r\n",
      "was not aware that the gently-snoring Sid was awake, and had been so for\r\n",
      "an hour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Tom awoke, Sid was dressed and gone. There was a late look in the\r\n",
      "light, a late sense in the atmosphere. He was startled. Why had he not\r\n",
      "been called—persecuted till he was up, as usual? The thought filled\r\n",
      "him with bodings. Within five minutes he was dressed and down-stairs,\r\n",
      "feeling sore and drowsy. The family were still at table, but they had\r\n",
      "finished breakfast. There was no voice of rebuke; but there were averted\r\n",
      "eyes; there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a chill\r\n",
      "to the culprit’s heart. He sat down and tried to seem gay, but it\r\n",
      "was up-hill work; it roused no smile, no response, and he lapsed into\r\n",
      "silence and let his heart sink down to the depths.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After breakfast his aunt took him aside, and Tom almost brightened in\r\n",
      "the hope that he was going to be flogged; but it was not so. His aunt\r\n",
      "wept over him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart so;\r\n",
      "and finally told him to go on, and ruin himself and bring her gray hairs\r\n",
      "with sorrow to the grave, for it was no use for her to try any more.\r\n",
      "This was worse than a thousand whippings, and Tom’s heart was sorer now\r\n",
      "than his body. He cried, he pleaded for forgiveness, promised to reform\r\n",
      "over and over again, and then received his dismissal, feeling that\r\n",
      "he had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble\r\n",
      "confidence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful toward\r\n",
      "Sid; and so the latter’s prompt retreat through the back gate was\r\n",
      "unnecessary. He moped to school gloomy and sad, and took his flogging,\r\n",
      "along with Joe Harper, for playing hookey the day before, with the\r\n",
      "air of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead to\r\n",
      "trifles. Then he betook himself to his seat, rested his elbows on his\r\n",
      "desk and his jaws in his hands, and stared at the wall with the stony\r\n",
      "stare of suffering that has reached the limit and can no further go.\r\n",
      "His elbow was pressing against some hard substance. After a long time\r\n",
      "he slowly and sadly changed his position, and took up this object with\r\n",
      "a sigh. It was in a paper. He unrolled it. A long, lingering, colossal\r\n",
      "sigh followed, and his heart broke. It was his brass andiron knob!\r\n",

      "the tale flew from man to man, from group to group, from house to house,\r\n",
      "with little less than telegraphic speed. Of course the schoolmaster gave\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "A gory knife had been found close to the murdered man, and it had been\r\n",
      "recognized by somebody as belonging to Muff Potter—so the story ran. And\r\n",
      "it was said that a belated citizen had come upon Potter washing himself\r\n",
      "in the “branch” about one or two o’clock in the morning, and that Potter\r\n",
      "had at once sneaked off—suspicious circumstances, especially the washing\r\n",
      "which was not a habit with Potter. It was also said that the town had\r\n",
      "been ransacked for this “murderer” (the public are not slow in the\r\n",
      "matter of sifting evidence and arriving at a verdict), but that he\r\n",
      "could not be found. Horsemen had departed down all the roads in every\r\n",
      "direction, and the Sheriff “was confident” that he would be captured\r\n",
      "before night.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All the town was drifting toward the graveyard. Tom’s heartbreak\r\n",
      "vanished and he joined the procession, not because he would not\r\n",
      "a thousand times rather go anywhere else, but because an awful,\r\n",
      "unaccountable fascination drew him on. Arrived at the dreadful place, he\r\n",
      "wormed his small body through the crowd and saw the dismal spectacle.\r\n",
      "It seemed to him an age since he was there before. Somebody pinched\r\n",
      "his arm. He turned, and his eyes met Huckleberry’s. Then both looked\r\n",
      "elsewhere at once, and wondered if anybody had noticed anything in their\r\n",

      "“Poor fellow!” “Poor young fellow!” “This ought to be a lesson to grave\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The crowd fell apart, now, and the Sheriff came through, ostentatiously\r\n",
      "leading Potter by the arm. The poor fellow’s face was haggard, and\r\n",
      "his eyes showed the fear that was upon him. When he stood before the\r\n",
      "murdered man, he shook as with a palsy, and he put his face in his hands\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, Injun Joe, you promised me you’d never—”\r\n",

      "and wondering to see how long the stroke was delayed. And when he had\r\n",
      "finished and still stood alive and whole, their wavering impulse to\r\n",
      "break their oath and save the poor betrayed prisoner’s life faded and\r\n",
      "vanished away, for plainly this miscreant had sold himself to Satan and\r\n",

      "not take their fascinated eyes from his face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“And you do talk such stuff,” Sid said. “Last night you said, ‘It’s\r\n",

      "that he complained of toothache for a week, and tied up his jaws every\r\n",
      "night. He never knew that Sid lay nightly watching, and frequently\r\n",
      "slipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbow listening a good\r\n",
      "while at a time, and afterward slipped the bandage back to its place\r\n",
      "again. Tom’s distress of mind wore off gradually and the toothache grew\r\n",
      "irksome and was discarded. If Sid really managed to make anything out of\r\n",
      "Tom’s disjointed mutterings, he kept it to himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It seemed to Tom that his schoolmates never would get done holding\r\n",
      "inquests on dead cats, and thus keeping his trouble present to his mind.\r\n",
      "Sid noticed that Tom never was coroner at one of these inquiries,\r\n",
      "though it had been his habit to take the lead in all new enterprises;\r\n",
      "he noticed, too, that Tom never acted as a witness—and that was strange;\r\n",
      "and Sid did not overlook the fact that Tom even showed a marked aversion\r\n",
      "to these inquests, and always avoided them when he could. Sid marvelled,\r\n",
      "but said nothing. However, even inquests went out of vogue at last, and\r\n",
      "ceased to torture Tom’s conscience.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Every day or two, during this time of sorrow, Tom watched his\r\n",
      "opportunity and went to the little grated jail-window and smuggled such\r\n",
      "small comforts through to the “murderer” as he could get hold of. The\r\n",
      "jail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh at the edge\r\n",
      "of the village, and no guards were afforded for it; indeed, it\r\n",
      "was seldom occupied. These offerings greatly helped to ease Tom’s\r\n",
      "conscience.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The villagers had a strong desire to tar-and-feather Injun Joe and ride\r\n",
      "him on a rail, for body-snatching, but so formidable was his character\r\n",
      "that nobody could be found who was willing to take the lead in the\r\n",
      "matter, so it was dropped. He had been careful to begin both of his\r\n",
      "inquest-statements with the fight, without confessing the grave-robbery\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "ONE of the reasons why Tom’s mind had drifted away from its secret\r\n",
      "troubles was, that it had found a new and weighty matter to interest\r\n",
      "itself about. Becky Thatcher had stopped coming to school. Tom had\r\n",
      "struggled with his pride a few days, and tried to “whistle her down the\r\n",
      "wind,” but failed. He began to find himself hanging around her father’s\r\n",
      "house, nights, and feeling very miserable. She was ill. What if she\r\n",
      "should die! There was distraction in the thought. He no longer took an\r\n",
      "interest in war, nor even in piracy. The charm of life was gone; there\r\n",
      "was nothing but dreariness left. He put his hoop away, and his bat;\r\n",
      "there was no joy in them any more. His aunt was concerned. She began to\r\n",
      "try all manner of remedies on him. She was one of those people who\r\n",
      "are infatuated with patent medicines and all new-fangled methods of\r\n",
      "producing health or mending it. She was an inveterate experimenter in\r\n",
      "these things. When something fresh in this line came out she was in a\r\n",
      "fever, right away, to try it; not on herself, for she was never ailing,\r\n",
      "but on anybody else that came handy. She was a subscriber for all the\r\n",
      "“Health” periodicals and phrenological frauds; and the solemn ignorance\r\n",
      "they were inflated with was breath to her nostrils. All the “rot” they\r\n",
      "contained about ventilation, and how to go to bed, and how to get up,\r\n",
      "and what to eat, and what to drink, and how much exercise to take, and\r\n",
      "what frame of mind to keep one’s self in, and what sort of clothing\r\n",
      "to wear, was all gospel to her, and she never observed that her\r\n",
      "health-journals of the current month customarily upset everything they\r\n",
      "had recommended the month before. She was as simple-hearted and honest\r\n",
      "as the day was long, and so she was an easy victim. She gathered\r\n",
      "together her quack periodicals and her quack medicines, and thus armed\r\n",
      "with death, went about on her pale horse, metaphorically speaking, with\r\n",
      "“hell following after.” But she never suspected that she was not an\r\n",
      "angel of healing and the balm of Gilead in disguise, to the suffering\r\n",
      "neighbors.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The water treatment was new, now, and Tom’s low condition was a windfall\r\n",
      "to her. She had him out at daylight every morning, stood him up in the\r\n",
      "wood-shed and drowned him with a deluge of cold water; then she scrubbed\r\n",
      "him down with a towel like a file, and so brought him to; then she\r\n",
      "rolled him up in a wet sheet and put him away under blankets till she\r\n",
      "sweated his soul clean and “the yellow stains of it came through his\r\n",
      "pores”—as Tom said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yet notwithstanding all this, the boy grew more and more melancholy and\r\n",
      "pale and dejected. She added hot baths, sitz baths, shower baths, and\r\n",
      "plunges. The boy remained as dismal as a hearse. She began to assist the\r\n",
      "water with a slim oatmeal diet and blister-plasters. She calculated his\r\n",
      "capacity as she would a jug’s, and filled him up every day with quack\r\n",
      "cure-alls.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom had become indifferent to persecution by this time. This phase\r\n",
      "filled the old lady’s heart with consternation. This indifference must\r\n",
      "be broken up at any cost. Now she heard of Pain-killer for the first\r\n",
      "time. She ordered a lot at once. She tasted it and was filled with\r\n",
      "gratitude. It was simply fire in a liquid form. She dropped the water\r\n",
      "treatment and everything else, and pinned her faith to Pain-killer.\r\n",
      "She gave Tom a teaspoonful and watched with the deepest anxiety for the\r\n",
      "result. Her troubles were instantly at rest, her soul at peace again;\r\n",
      "for the “indifference” was broken up. The boy could not have shown a\r\n",
      "wilder, heartier interest, if she had built a fire under him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom felt that it was time to wake up; this sort of life might be\r\n",
      "romantic enough, in his blighted condition, but it was getting to have\r\n",
      "too little sentiment and too much distracting variety about it. So he\r\n",
      "thought over various plans for relief, and finally hit upon that of\r\n",
      "professing to be fond of Pain-killer. He asked for it so often that he\r\n",
      "became a nuisance, and his aunt ended by telling him to help himself and\r\n",
      "quit bothering her. If it had been Sid, she would have had no misgivings\r\n",
      "to alloy her delight; but since it was Tom, she watched the bottle\r\n",
      "clandestinely. She found that the medicine did really diminish, but it\r\n",

      "delivered a war-whoop and set off round and round the room, banging\r\n",
      "against furniture, upsetting flower-pots, and making general havoc. Next\r\n",
      "he rose on his hind feet and pranced around, in a frenzy of enjoyment,\r\n",
      "with his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming his\r\n",
      "unappeasable happiness. Then he went tearing around the house again\r\n",
      "spreading chaos and destruction in his path. Aunt Polly entered in time\r\n",
      "to see him throw a few double summersets, deliver a final mighty hurrah,\r\n",
      "and sail through the open window, carrying the rest of the flower-pots\r\n",
      "with him. The old lady stood petrified with astonishment, peering over\r\n",
      "her glasses; Tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tom, what on earth ails that cat?”\r\n",

      "“I don’t know, aunt,” gasped the boy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, I never see anything like it. What did make him act so?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Deed I don’t know, Aunt Polly; cats always act so when they’re having a\r\n",
      "good time.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They do, do they?” There was something in the tone that made Tom\r\n",
      "apprehensive.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes’m. That is, I believe they do.”\r\n",

      "by anxiety. Too late he divined her “drift.” The handle of the telltale\r\n",
      "tea-spoon was visible under the bed-valance. Aunt Polly took it, held it\r\n",
      "up. Tom winced, and dropped his eyes. Aunt Polly raised him by the usual\r\n",
      "handle—his ear—and cracked his head soundly with her thimble.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Heaps. Because if he’d had one she’d a burnt him out herself! She’d a\r\n",

      "human!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Aunt Polly felt a sudden pang of remorse. This was putting the thing in\r\n",
      "a new light; what was cruelty to a cat _might_ be cruelty to a boy, too.\r\n",
      "She began to soften; she felt sorry. Her eyes watered a little, and she\r\n",
      "put her hand on Tom’s head and said gently:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I was meaning for the best, Tom. And, Tom, it _did_ do you good.”\r\n",

      "through his gravity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "more medicine.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom reached school ahead of time. It was noticed that this strange thing\r\n",
      "had been occurring every day latterly. And now, as usual of late,\r\n",
      "he hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with his\r\n",
      "comrades. He was sick, he said, and he looked it. He tried to seem to\r\n",
      "be looking everywhere but whither he really was looking—down the road.\r\n",
      "Presently Jeff Thatcher hove in sight, and Tom’s face lighted; he gazed\r\n",
      "a moment, and then turned sorrowfully away. When Jeff arrived, Tom\r\n",
      "accosted him; and “led up” warily to opportunities for remark about\r\n",
      "Becky, but the giddy lad never could see the bait. Tom watched and\r\n",
      "watched, hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight, and hating the\r\n",
      "owner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one. At last frocks\r\n",
      "ceased to appear, and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps; he entered\r\n",
      "the empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer. Then one more frock passed\r\n",
      "in at the gate, and Tom’s heart gave a great bound. The next instant he\r\n",
      "was out, and “going on” like an Indian; yelling, laughing, chasing boys,\r\n",
      "jumping over the fence at risk of life and limb, throwing handsprings,\r\n",
      "standing on his head—doing all the heroic things he could conceive of,\r\n",
      "and keeping a furtive eye out, all the while, to see if Becky Thatcher\r\n",
      "was noticing. But she seemed to be unconscious of it all; she never\r\n",
      "looked. Could it be possible that she was not aware that he was there?\r\n",
      "He carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity; came war-whooping\r\n",
      "around, snatched a boy’s cap, hurled it to the roof of the schoolhouse,\r\n",
      "broke through a group of boys, tumbling them in every direction, and\r\n",
      "fell sprawling, himself, under Becky’s nose, almost upsetting her—and\r\n",
      "she turned, with her nose in the air, and he heard her say: “Mf! some\r\n",
      "people think they’re mighty smart—always showing off!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "TOM’S mind was made up now. He was gloomy and desperate. He was a\r\n",
      "forsaken, friendless boy, he said; nobody loved him; when they found out\r\n",
      "what they had driven him to, perhaps they would be sorry; he had tried\r\n",
      "to do right and get along, but they would not let him; since nothing\r\n",
      "would do them but to be rid of him, let it be so; and let them blame\r\n",
      "_him_ for the consequences—why shouldn’t they? What right had the\r\n",
      "friendless to complain? Yes, they had forced him to it at last: he would\r\n",
      "lead a life of crime. There was no choice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By this time he was far down Meadow Lane, and the bell for school to\r\n",
      "“take up” tinkled faintly upon his ear. He sobbed, now, to think he\r\n",
      "should never, never hear that old familiar sound any more—it was very\r\n",
      "hard, but it was forced on him; since he was driven out into the cold\r\n",
      "world, he must submit—but he forgave them. Then the sobs came thick and\r\n",
      "fast.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Just at this point he met his soul’s sworn comrade, Joe\r\n",
      "Harper—hard-eyed, and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his\r\n",
      "heart. Plainly here were “two souls with but a single thought.” Tom,\r\n",
      "wiping his eyes with his sleeve, began to blubber out something about\r\n",
      "a resolution to escape from hard usage and lack of sympathy at home by\r\n",
      "roaming abroad into the great world never to return; and ended by hoping\r\n",
      "that Joe would not forget him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But it transpired that this was a request which Joe had just been going\r\n",
      "to make of Tom, and had come to hunt him up for that purpose. His mother\r\n",
      "had whipped him for drinking some cream which he had never tasted and\r\n",
      "knew nothing about; it was plain that she was tired of him and wished\r\n",
      "him to go; if she felt that way, there was nothing for him to do but\r\n",
      "succumb; he hoped she would be happy, and never regret having driven her\r\n",
      "poor boy out into the unfeeling world to suffer and die.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As the two boys walked sorrowing along, they made a new compact to stand\r\n",
      "by each other and be brothers and never separate till death relieved\r\n",
      "them of their troubles. Then they began to lay their plans. Joe was for\r\n",
      "being a hermit, and living on crusts in a remote cave, and dying,\r\n",
      "some time, of cold and want and grief; but after listening to Tom, he\r\n",
      "conceded that there were some conspicuous advantages about a life of\r\n",
      "crime, and so he consented to be a pirate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Three miles below St. Petersburg, at a point where the Mississippi River\r\n",
      "was a trifle over a mile wide, there was a long, narrow, wooded island,\r\n",
      "with a shallow bar at the head of it, and this offered well as a\r\n",
      "rendezvous. It was not inhabited; it lay far over toward the further\r\n",
      "shore, abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest. So Jackson’s\r\n",
      "Island was chosen. Who were to be the subjects of their piracies was a\r\n",
      "matter that did not occur to them. Then they hunted up Huckleberry Finn,\r\n",
      "and he joined them promptly, for all careers were one to him; he was\r\n",
      "indifferent. They presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on the\r\n",
      "river-bank two miles above the village at the favorite hour—which was\r\n",
      "midnight. There was a small log raft there which they meant to capture.\r\n",
      "Each would bring hooks and lines, and such provision as he could steal\r\n",
      "in the most dark and mysterious way—as became outlaws. And before the\r\n",
      "afternoon was done, they had all managed to enjoy the sweet glory of\r\n",
      "spreading the fact that pretty soon the town would “hear something.” All\r\n",
      "who got this vague hint were cautioned to “be mum and wait.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "About midnight Tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles,\r\n",
      "and stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the\r\n",
      "meeting-place. It was starlight, and very still. The mighty river lay\r\n",
      "like an ocean at rest. Tom listened a moment, but no sound disturbed the\r\n",
      "quiet. Then he gave a low, distinct whistle. It was answered from under\r\n",
      "the bluff. Tom whistled twice more; these signals were answered in the\r\n",
      "same way. Then a guarded voice said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who goes there?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tom Sawyer, the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main. Name your names.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Huck Finn the Red-Handed, and Joe Harper the Terror of the Seas.” Tom\r\n",
      "had furnished these titles, from his favorite literature.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“’Tis well. Give the countersign.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to the\r\n",
      "brooding night:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“_Blood_!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it,\r\n",
      "tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort. There was\r\n",
      "an easy, comfortable path along the shore under the bluff, but it lacked\r\n",
      "the advantages of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Terror of the Seas had brought a side of bacon, and had about worn\r\n",
      "himself out with getting it there. Finn the Red-Handed had stolen a\r\n",
      "skillet and a quantity of half-cured leaf tobacco, and had also brought\r\n",
      "a few corn-cobs to make pipes with. But none of the pirates smoked or\r\n",
      "“chewed” but himself. The Black Avenger of the Spanish Main said it\r\n",
      "would never do to start without some fire. That was a wise thought;\r\n",
      "matches were hardly known there in that day. They saw a fire smouldering\r\n",
      "upon a great raft a hundred yards above, and they went stealthily\r\n",
      "thither and helped themselves to a chunk. They made an imposing\r\n",
      "adventure of it, saying, “Hist!” every now and then, and suddenly\r\n",
      "halting with finger on lip; moving with hands on imaginary dagger-hilts;\r\n",
      "and giving orders in dismal whispers that if “the foe” stirred, to “let\r\n",
      "him have it to the hilt,” because “dead men tell no tales.” They knew\r\n",
      "well enough that the raftsmen were all down at the village laying\r\n",
      "in stores or having a spree, but still that was no excuse for their\r\n",
      "conducting this thing in an unpiratical way.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They shoved off, presently, Tom in command, Huck at the after oar and\r\n",
      "Joe at the forward. Tom stood amidships, gloomy-browed, and with folded\r\n",
      "arms, and gave his orders in a low, stern whisper:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Luff, and bring her to the wind!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Aye-aye, sir!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Steady, steady-y-y-y!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Steady it is, sir!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let her go off a point!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Point it is, sir!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As the boys steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward mid-stream\r\n",
      "it was no doubt understood that these orders were given only for\r\n",
      "“style,” and were not intended to mean anything in particular.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What sail’s she carrying?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Courses, tops’ls, and flying-jib, sir.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Send the r’yals up! Lay out aloft, there, half a dozen of\r\n",
      "ye—foretopmaststuns’l! Lively, now!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Aye-aye, sir!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Shake out that maintogalans’l! Sheets and braces! _now_ my hearties!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Aye-aye, sir!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hellum-a-lee—hard a port! Stand by to meet her when she comes! Port,\r\n",
      "port! _Now_, men! With a will! Stead-y-y-y!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Steady it is, sir!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The raft drew beyond the middle of the river; the boys pointed her head\r\n",
      "right, and then lay on their oars. The river was not high, so there was\r\n",
      "not more than a two or three mile current. Hardly a word was said during\r\n",
      "the next three-quarters of an hour. Now the raft was passing before\r\n",
      "the distant town. Two or three glimmering lights showed where it lay,\r\n",
      "peacefully sleeping, beyond the vague vast sweep of star-gemmed water,\r\n",
      "unconscious of the tremendous event that was happening. The Black\r\n",
      "Avenger stood still with folded arms, “looking his last” upon the scene\r\n",
      "of his former joys and his later sufferings, and wishing “she” could see\r\n",
      "him now, abroad on the wild sea, facing peril and death with dauntless\r\n",
      "heart, going to his doom with a grim smile on his lips. It was but\r\n",
      "a small strain on his imagination to remove Jackson’s Island beyond\r\n",
      "eye-shot of the village, and so he “looked his last” with a broken and\r\n",
      "satisfied heart. The other pirates were looking their last, too; and\r\n",
      "they all looked so long that they came near letting the current drift\r\n",
      "them out of the range of the island. But they discovered the danger in\r\n",
      "time, and made shift to avert it. About two o’clock in the morning the\r\n",
      "raft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island,\r\n",
      "and they waded back and forth until they had landed their freight. Part\r\n",
      "of the little raft’s belongings consisted of an old sail, and this they\r\n",
      "spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions;\r\n",
      "but they themselves would sleep in the open air in good weather, as\r\n",
      "became outlaws.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty steps\r\n",
      "within the sombre depths of the forest, and then cooked some bacon in\r\n",
      "the frying-pan for supper, and used up half of the corn “pone” stock\r\n",
      "they had brought. It seemed glorious sport to be feasting in that wild,\r\n",
      "free way in the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabited island,\r\n",
      "far from the haunts of men, and they said they never would return to\r\n",
      "civilization. The climbing fire lit up their faces and threw its ruddy\r\n",
      "glare upon the pillared tree-trunks of their forest temple, and upon the\r\n",
      "varnished foliage and festooning vines.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the last crisp slice of bacon was gone, and the last allowance\r\n",
      "of corn pone devoured, the boys stretched themselves out on the grass,\r\n",
      "filled with contentment. They could have found a cooler place, but\r\n",
      "they would not deny themselves such a romantic feature as the roasting\r\n",
      "campfire.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“_Ain’t_ it gay?” said Joe.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s _nuts_!” said Tom. “What would the boys say if they could see us?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Say? Well, they’d just die to be here—hey, Hucky!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I reckon so,” said Huckleberry; “anyways, I’m suited. I don’t want\r\n",
      "nothing better’n this. I don’t ever get enough to eat, gen’ally—and here\r\n",
      "they can’t come and pick at a feller and bullyrag him so.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s just the life for me,” said Tom. “You don’t have to get up,\r\n",
      "mornings, and you don’t have to go to school, and wash, and all that\r\n",
      "blame foolishness. You see a pirate don’t have to do _anything_, Joe,\r\n",
      "when he’s ashore, but a hermit _he_ has to be praying considerable, and\r\n",
      "then he don’t have any fun, anyway, all by himself that way.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh yes, that’s so,” said Joe, “but I hadn’t thought much about it, you\r\n",
      "know. I’d a good deal rather be a pirate, now that I’ve tried it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You see,” said Tom, “people don’t go much on hermits, nowadays, like\r\n",
      "they used to in old times, but a pirate’s always respected. And\r\n",
      "a hermit’s got to sleep on the hardest place he can find, and put\r\n",
      "sackcloth and ashes on his head, and stand out in the rain, and—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for?” inquired Huck.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I dono. But they’ve _got_ to do it. Hermits always do. You’d have to do\r\n",
      "that if you was a hermit.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dern’d if I would,” said Huck.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, what would you do?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I dono. But I wouldn’t do that.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, Huck, you’d _have_ to. How’d you get around it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, I just wouldn’t stand it. I’d run away.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Run away! Well, you _would_ be a nice old slouch of a hermit. You’d be\r\n",
      "a disgrace.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Red-Handed made no response, being better employed. He had finished\r\n",
      "gouging out a cob, and now he fitted a weed stem to it, loaded it with\r\n",
      "tobacco, and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a cloud of\r\n",
      "fragrant smoke—he was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment. The\r\n",
      "other pirates envied him this majestic vice, and secretly resolved to\r\n",
      "acquire it shortly. Presently Huck said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What does pirates have to do?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, they have just a bully time—take ships and burn them, and get the\r\n",
      "money and bury it in awful places in their island where there’s ghosts\r\n",
      "and things to watch it, and kill everybody in the ships—make ’em walk a\r\n",
      "plank.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And they carry the women to the island,” said Joe; “they don’t kill the\r\n",
      "women.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” assented Tom, “they don’t kill the women—they’re too noble. And\r\n",
      "the women’s always beautiful, too.\r\n",

      "But the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enough,\r\n",

      "The Terror of the Seas and the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main had\r\n",
      "more difficulty in getting to sleep. They said their prayers inwardly,\r\n",
      "and lying down, since there was nobody there with authority to make them\r\n",
      "kneel and recite aloud; in truth, they had a mind not to say them at\r\n",
      "all, but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that, lest they\r\n",
      "might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from heaven. Then at\r\n",
      "once they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep—but an\r\n",
      "intruder came, now, that would not “down.” It was conscience. They began\r\n",
      "to feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away; and\r\n",
      "next they thought of the stolen meat, and then the real torture came.\r\n",
      "They tried to argue it away by reminding conscience that they had\r\n",
      "purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times; but conscience was not\r\n",
      "to be appeased by such thin plausibilities; it seemed to them, in the\r\n",
      "end, that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking\r\n",
      "sweetmeats was only “hooking,” while taking bacon and hams and such\r\n",
      "valuables was plain simple stealing—and there was a command against that\r\n",
      "in the Bible. So they inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in\r\n",
      "the business, their piracies should not again be sullied with the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "WHEN Tom awoke in the morning, he wondered where he was. He sat up and\r\n",
      "rubbed his eyes and looked around. Then he comprehended. It was the cool\r\n",
      "gray dawn, and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in the\r\n",
      "deep pervading calm and silence of the woods. Not a leaf stirred; not\r\n",
      "a sound obtruded upon great Nature’s meditation. Beaded dewdrops stood\r\n",
      "upon the leaves and grasses. A white layer of ashes covered the fire,\r\n",
      "and a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air. Joe and Huck\r\n",
      "still slept.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, far away in the woods a bird called; another answered; presently\r\n",
      "the hammering of a woodpecker was heard. Gradually the cool dim gray\r\n",
      "of the morning whitened, and as gradually sounds multiplied and life\r\n",
      "manifested itself. The marvel of Nature shaking off sleep and going\r\n",
      "to work unfolded itself to the musing boy. A little green worm came\r\n",
      "crawling over a dewy leaf, lifting two-thirds of his body into the air\r\n",
      "from time to time and “sniffing around,” then proceeding again—for he\r\n",
      "was measuring, Tom said; and when the worm approached him, of its own\r\n",
      "accord, he sat as still as a stone, with his hopes rising and falling,\r\n",
      "by turns, as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to\r\n",
      "go elsewhere; and when at last it considered a painful moment with its\r\n",
      "curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon Tom’s leg and\r\n",
      "began a journey over him, his whole heart was glad—for that meant that\r\n",
      "he was going to have a new suit of clothes—without the shadow of a\r\n",
      "doubt a gaudy piratical uniform. Now a procession of ants appeared,\r\n",
      "from nowhere in particular, and went about their labors; one struggled\r\n",
      "manfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms,\r\n",
      "and lugged it straight up a tree-trunk. A brown spotted lady-bug climbed\r\n",
      "the dizzy height of a grass blade, and Tom bent down close to it and\r\n",
      "said, “Lady-bug, lady-bug, fly away home, your house is on fire, your\r\n",
      "children’s alone,” and she took wing and went off to see about it—which\r\n",
      "did not surprise the boy, for he knew of old that this insect was\r\n",
      "credulous about conflagrations, and he had practised upon its simplicity\r\n",
      "more than once. A tumblebug came next, heaving sturdily at its ball, and\r\n",
      "Tom touched the creature, to see it shut its legs against its body\r\n",
      "and pretend to be dead. The birds were fairly rioting by this time. A\r\n",
      "catbird, the Northern mocker, lit in a tree over Tom’s head, and trilled\r\n",
      "out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment; then\r\n",
      "a shrill jay swept down, a flash of blue flame, and stopped on a twig\r\n",
      "almost within the boy’s reach, cocked his head to one side and eyed the\r\n",
      "strangers with a consuming curiosity; a gray squirrel and a big fellow\r\n",
      "of the “fox” kind came skurrying along, sitting up at intervals to\r\n",
      "inspect and chatter at the boys, for the wild things had probably never\r\n",
      "seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not.\r\n",
      "All Nature was wide awake and stirring, now; long lances of sunlight\r\n",
      "pierced down through the dense foliage far and near, and a few\r\n",
      "butterflies came fluttering upon the scene.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with\r\n",
      "a shout, and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and\r\n",
      "tumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white\r\n",
      "sandbar. They felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the\r\n",
      "distance beyond the majestic waste of water. A vagrant current or a\r\n",
      "slight rise in the river had carried off their raft, but this only\r\n",
      "gratified them, since its going was something like burning the bridge\r\n",
      "between them and civilization.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They came back to camp wonderfully refreshed, glad-hearted, and\r\n",
      "ravenous; and they soon had the camp-fire blazing up again. Huck found a\r\n",
      "spring of clear cold water close by, and the boys made cups of broad oak\r\n",
      "or hickory leaves, and felt that water, sweetened with such a wildwood\r\n",
      "charm as that, would be a good enough substitute for coffee. While Joe\r\n",
      "was slicing bacon for breakfast, Tom and Huck asked him to hold on a\r\n",
      "minute; they stepped to a promising nook in the river-bank and threw in\r\n",
      "their lines; almost immediately they had reward. Joe had not had time\r\n",
      "to get impatient before they were back again with some handsome bass,\r\n",
      "a couple of sun-perch and a small catfish—provisions enough for quite a\r\n",
      "family. They fried the fish with the bacon, and were astonished; for\r\n",
      "no fish had ever seemed so delicious before. They did not know that the\r\n",
      "quicker a fresh-water fish is on the fire after he is caught the better\r\n",
      "he is; and they reflected little upon what a sauce open-air sleeping,\r\n",
      "open-air exercise, bathing, and a large ingredient of hunger make, too.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They lay around in the shade, after breakfast, while Huck had a smoke,\r\n",
      "and then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition. They\r\n",
      "tramped gayly along, over decaying logs, through tangled underbrush,\r\n",
      "among solemn monarchs of the forest, hung from their crowns to the\r\n",
      "ground with a drooping regalia of grape-vines. Now and then they came\r\n",
      "upon snug nooks carpeted with grass and jeweled with flowers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They found plenty of things to be delighted with, but nothing to be\r\n",
      "astonished at. They discovered that the island was about three miles\r\n",
      "long and a quarter of a mile wide, and that the shore it lay closest to\r\n",
      "was only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards\r\n",
      "wide. They took a swim about every hour, so it was close upon the middle\r\n",
      "of the afternoon when they got back to camp. They were too hungry to\r\n",
      "stop to fish, but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham, and then threw\r\n",
      "themselves down in the shade to talk. But the talk soon began to drag,\r\n",
      "and then died. The stillness, the solemnity that brooded in the woods,\r\n",
      "and the sense of loneliness, began to tell upon the spirits of the boys.\r\n",
      "They fell to thinking. A sort of undefined longing crept upon them. This\r\n",
      "took dim shape, presently—it was budding homesickness. Even Finn the\r\n",
      "Red-Handed was dreaming of his doorsteps and empty hogsheads. But they\r\n",
      "were all ashamed of their weakness, and none was brave enough to speak\r\n",
      "his thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For some time, now, the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiar\r\n",
      "sound in the distance, just as one sometimes is of the ticking of a\r\n",
      "clock which he takes no distinct note of. But now this mysterious sound\r\n",
      "became more pronounced, and forced a recognition. The boys started,\r\n",
      "glanced at each other, and then each assumed a listening attitude. There\r\n",
      "was a long silence, profound and unbroken; then a deep, sullen boom came\r\n",
      "floating down out of the distance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is it!” exclaimed Joe, under his breath.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I wonder,” said Tom in a whisper.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“’Tain’t thunder,” said Huckleberry, in an awed tone, “becuz thunder—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hark!” said Tom. “Listen—don’t talk.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They waited a time that seemed an age, and then the same muffled boom\r\n",
      "troubled the solemn hush.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let’s go and see.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town. They\r\n",
      "parted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water. The little\r\n",
      "steam ferry-boat was about a mile below the village, drifting with the\r\n",
      "current. Her broad deck seemed crowded with people. There were a great\r\n",
      "many skiffs rowing about or floating with the stream in the neighborhood\r\n",
      "of the ferryboat, but the boys could not determine what the men in\r\n",
      "them were doing. Presently a great jet of white smoke burst from the\r\n",
      "ferryboat’s side, and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud, that same\r\n",
      "dull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I know now!” exclaimed Tom; “somebody’s drownded!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s it!” said Huck; “they done that last summer, when Bill Turner\r\n",
      "got drownded; they shoot a cannon over the water, and that makes\r\n",
      "him come up to the top. Yes, and they take loaves of bread and put\r\n",
      "quicksilver in ’em and set ’em afloat, and wherever there’s anybody\r\n",
      "that’s drownded, they’ll float right there and stop.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I’ve heard about that,” said Joe. “I wonder what makes the bread\r\n",
      "do that.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, it ain’t the bread, so much,” said Tom; “I reckon it’s mostly what\r\n",
      "they _say_ over it before they start it out.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But they don’t say anything over it,” said Huck. “I’ve seen ’em and\r\n",
      "they don’t.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, that’s funny,” said Tom. “But maybe they say it to themselves. Of\r\n",
      "_course_ they do. Anybody might know that.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The other boys agreed that there was reason in what Tom said, because\r\n",
      "an ignorant lump of bread, uninstructed by an incantation, could not\r\n",
      "be expected to act very intelligently when set upon an errand of such\r\n",
      "gravity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“By jings, I wish I was over there, now,” said Joe.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I do too” said Huck “I’d give heaps to know who it is.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The boys still listened and watched. Presently a revealing thought\r\n",
      "flashed through Tom’s mind, and he exclaimed:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Boys, I know who’s drownded—it’s us!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They felt like heroes in an instant. Here was a gorgeous triumph; they\r\n",
      "were missed; they were mourned; hearts were breaking on their account;\r\n",
      "tears were being shed; accusing memories of unkindness to these poor\r\n",
      "lost lads were rising up, and unavailing regrets and remorse were being\r\n",
      "indulged; and best of all, the departed were the talk of the whole town,\r\n",
      "and the envy of all the boys, as far as this dazzling notoriety was\r\n",
      "concerned. This was fine. It was worth while to be a pirate, after all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As twilight drew on, the ferryboat went back to her accustomed business\r\n",
      "and the skiffs disappeared. The pirates returned to camp. They were\r\n",
      "jubilant with vanity over their new grandeur and the illustrious trouble\r\n",
      "they were making. They caught fish, cooked supper and ate it, and then\r\n",
      "fell to guessing at what the village was thinking and saying about them;\r\n",
      "and the pictures they drew of the public distress on their account were\r\n",
      "gratifying to look upon—from their point of view. But when the shadows\r\n",
      "of night closed them in, they gradually ceased to talk, and sat gazing\r\n",
      "into the fire, with their minds evidently wandering elsewhere. The\r\n",
      "excitement was gone, now, and Tom and Joe could not keep back thoughts\r\n",
      "of certain persons at home who were not enjoying this fine frolic as\r\n",
      "much as they were. Misgivings came; they grew troubled and unhappy; a\r\n",
      "sigh or two escaped, unawares. By and by Joe timidly ventured upon a\r\n",
      "roundabout “feeler” as to how the others might look upon a return to\r\n",
      "civilization—not right now, but—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom withered him with derision! Huck, being uncommitted as yet, joined\r\n",
      "in with Tom, and the waverer quickly “explained,” and was glad to get\r\n",
      "out of the scrape with as little taint of chicken-hearted home-sickness\r\n",
      "clinging to his garments as he could. Mutiny was effectually laid to\r\n",
      "rest for the moment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As the night deepened, Huck began to nod, and presently to snore.\r\n",
      "Joe followed next. Tom lay upon his elbow motionless, for some time,\r\n",
      "watching the two intently. At last he got up cautiously, on his knees,\r\n",
      "and went searching among the grass and the flickering reflections flung\r\n",
      "by the campfire. He picked up and inspected several large semi-cylinders\r\n",
      "of the thin white bark of a sycamore, and finally chose two which seemed\r\n",
      "to suit him. Then he knelt by the fire and painfully wrote something\r\n",
      "upon each of these with his “red keel”; one he rolled up and put in his\r\n",
      "jacket pocket, and the other he put in Joe’s hat and removed it to a\r\n",
      "little distance from the owner. And he also put into the hat certain\r\n",
      "schoolboy treasures of almost inestimable value—among them a lump of\r\n",
      "chalk, an India-rubber ball, three fishhooks, and one of that kind\r\n",
      "of marbles known as a “sure ’nough crystal.” Then he tiptoed his way\r\n",
      "cautiously among the trees till he felt that he was out of hearing, and\r\n",
      "straightway broke into a keen run in the direction of the sandbar.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "A few minutes later Tom was in the shoal water of the bar, wading toward\r\n",
      "the Illinois shore. Before the depth reached his middle he was halfway\r\n",
      "over; the current would permit no more wading, now, so he struck out\r\n",
      "confidently to swim the remaining hundred yards. He swam quartering\r\n",
      "upstream, but still was swept downward rather faster than he had\r\n",
      "expected. However, he reached the shore finally, and drifted along till\r\n",
      "he found a low place and drew himself out. He put his hand on his jacket\r\n",
      "pocket, found his piece of bark safe, and then struck through the woods,\r\n",
      "following the shore, with streaming garments. Shortly before ten\r\n",
      "o’clock he came out into an open place opposite the village, and saw the\r\n",
      "ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank. Everything\r\n",
      "was quiet under the blinking stars. He crept down the bank, watching\r\n",
      "with all his eyes, slipped into the water, swam three or four strokes\r\n",
      "and climbed into the skiff that did “yawl” duty at the boat’s stern. He\r\n",
      "laid himself down under the thwarts and waited, panting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Presently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to “cast\r\n",
      "off.” A minute or two later the skiff’s head was standing high up,\r\n",
      "against the boat’s swell, and the voyage was begun. Tom felt happy in\r\n",
      "his success, for he knew it was the boat’s last trip for the night. At\r\n",
      "the end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped, and\r\n",
      "Tom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk, landing fifty yards\r\n",
      "downstream, out of danger of possible stragglers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He flew along unfrequented alleys, and shortly found himself at his\r\n",
      "aunt’s back fence. He climbed over, approached the “ell,” and looked\r\n",
      "in at the sitting-room window, for a light was burning there. There\r\n",
      "sat Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, and Joe Harper’s mother, grouped together,\r\n",
      "talking. They were by the bed, and the bed was between them and the\r\n",
      "door. Tom went to the door and began to softly lift the latch; then\r\n",
      "he pressed gently and the door yielded a crack; he continued pushing\r\n",
      "cautiously, and quaking every time it creaked, till he judged he might\r\n",
      "squeeze through on his knees; so he put his head through and began,\r\n",
      "warily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What makes the candle blow so?” said Aunt Polly. Tom hurried up. “Why,\r\n",
      "that door’s open, I believe. Why, of course it is. No end of strange\r\n",
      "things now. Go ’long and shut it, Sid.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom disappeared under the bed just in time. He lay and “breathed”\r\n",
      " himself for a time, and then crept to where he could almost touch his\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“But as I was saying,” said Aunt Polly, “he warn’t _bad_, so to say—only\r\n",
      "misch_ee_vous. Only just giddy, and harum-scarum, you know. He warn’t\r\n",
      "any more responsible than a colt. _He_ never meant any harm, and he was\r\n",
      "the best-hearted boy that ever was”—and she began to cry.\r\n",

      "“It was just so with my Joe—always full of his devilment, and up to\r\n",

      "busted a firecracker right under my nose and I knocked him sprawling.\r\n",
      "Little did I know then, how soon—Oh, if it was to do over again I’d hug\r\n",
      "him and bless him for it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, yes, yes, I know just how you feel, Mrs. Harper, I know just\r\n",
      "exactly how you feel. No longer ago than yesterday noon, my Tom took\r\n",
      "and filled the cat full of Pain-killer, and I did think the cretur would\r\n",
      "tear the house down. And God forgive me, I cracked Tom’s head with my\r\n",
      "thimble, poor boy, poor dead boy. But he’s out of all his troubles now.\r\n",
      "And the last words I ever heard him say was to reproach—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But this memory was too much for the old lady, and she broke entirely\r\n",
      "down. Tom was snuffling, now, himself—and more in pity of himself than\r\n",
      "anybody else. He could hear Mary crying, and putting in a kindly word\r\n",
      "for him from time to time. He began to have a nobler opinion of himself\r\n",
      "than ever before. Still, he was sufficiently touched by his aunt’s grief\r\n",
      "to long to rush out from under the bed and overwhelm her with joy—and\r\n",
      "the theatrical gorgeousness of the thing appealed strongly to his\r\n",
      "nature, too, but he resisted and lay still.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went on listening, and gathered by odds and ends that it was\r\n",
      "conjectured at first that the boys had got drowned while taking a swim;\r\n",
      "then the small raft had been missed; next, certain boys said the missing\r\n",
      "lads had promised that the village should “hear something” soon; the\r\n",
      "wise-heads had “put this and that together” and decided that the lads\r\n",
      "had gone off on that raft and would turn up at the next town below,\r\n",
      "presently; but toward noon the raft had been found, lodged against the\r\n",
      "Missouri shore some five or six miles below the village—and then hope\r\n",
      "perished; they must be drowned, else hunger would have driven them home\r\n",
      "by nightfall if not sooner. It was believed that the search for the\r\n",
      "bodies had been a fruitless effort merely because the drowning must\r\n",
      "have occurred in mid-channel, since the boys, being good swimmers, would\r\n",
      "otherwise have escaped to shore. This was Wednesday night. If the bodies\r\n",
      "continued missing until Sunday, all hope would be given over, and the\r\n",
      "funerals would be preached on that morning. Tom shuddered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Harper gave a sobbing goodnight and turned to go. Then with a\r\n",
      "mutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each other’s\r\n",
      "arms and had a good, consoling cry, and then parted. Aunt Polly was\r\n",
      "tender far beyond her wont, in her goodnight to Sid and Mary. Sid\r\n",
      "snuffled a bit and Mary went off crying with all her heart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Aunt Polly knelt down and prayed for Tom so touchingly, so appealingly,\r\n",
      "and with such measureless love in her words and her old trembling voice,\r\n",
      "that he was weltering in tears again, long before she was through.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had to keep still long after she went to bed, for she kept making\r\n",
      "broken-hearted ejaculations from time to time, tossing unrestfully, and\r\n",
      "turning over. But at last she was still, only moaning a little in her\r\n",
      "sleep. Now the boy stole out, rose gradually by the bedside, shaded the\r\n",
      "candle-light with his hand, and stood regarding her. His heart was full\r\n",
      "of pity for her. He took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the\r\n",
      "candle. But something occurred to him, and he lingered considering.\r\n",
      "His face lighted with a happy solution of his thought; he put the bark\r\n",
      "hastily in his pocket. Then he bent over and kissed the faded lips, and\r\n",
      "straightway made his stealthy exit, latching the door behind him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He threaded his way back to the ferry landing, found nobody at large\r\n",
      "there, and walked boldly on board the boat, for he knew she was\r\n",
      "tenantless except that there was a watchman, who always turned in and\r\n",
      "slept like a graven image. He untied the skiff at the stern, slipped\r\n",
      "into it, and was soon rowing cautiously upstream. When he had pulled a\r\n",
      "mile above the village, he started quartering across and bent himself\r\n",
      "stoutly to his work. He hit the landing on the other side neatly, for\r\n",
      "this was a familiar bit of work to him. He was moved to capture\r\n",
      "the skiff, arguing that it might be considered a ship and therefore\r\n",
      "legitimate prey for a pirate, but he knew a thorough search would be\r\n",
      "made for it and that might end in revelations. So he stepped ashore and\r\n",
      "entered the woods.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He sat down and took a long rest, torturing himself meanwhile to keep\r\n",
      "awake, and then started warily down the home-stretch. The night was far\r\n",
      "spent. It was broad daylight before he found himself fairly abreast the\r\n",
      "island bar. He rested again until the sun was well up and gilding the\r\n",
      "great river with its splendor, and then he plunged into the stream. A\r\n",
      "little later he paused, dripping, upon the threshold of the camp, and\r\n",
      "heard Joe say:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, Tom’s true-blue, Huck, and he’ll come back. He won’t desert. He\r\n",
      "knows that would be a disgrace to a pirate, and Tom’s too proud for that\r\n",
      "sort of thing. He’s up to something or other. Now I wonder what?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, the things is ours, anyway, ain’t they?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Pretty near, but not yet, Huck. The writing says they are if he ain’t\r\n",
      "back here to breakfast.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Which he is!” exclaimed Tom, with fine dramatic effect, stepping\r\n",
      "grandly into camp.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly provided, and as the\r\n",
      "boys set to work upon it, Tom recounted (and adorned) his adventures.\r\n",
      "They were a vain and boastful company of heroes when the tale was done.\r\n",
      "Then Tom hid himself away in a shady nook to sleep till noon, and the\r\n",

      "AFTER dinner all the gang turned out to hunt for turtle eggs on the bar.\r\n",
      "They went about poking sticks into the sand, and when they found a soft\r\n",
      "place they went down on their knees and dug with their hands. Sometimes\r\n",
      "they would take fifty or sixty eggs out of one hole. They were perfectly\r\n",
      "round white things a trifle smaller than an English walnut. They had a\r\n",
      "famous fried-egg feast that night, and another on Friday morning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar, and\r\n",
      "chased each other round and round, shedding clothes as they went, until\r\n",
      "they were naked, and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal\r\n",
      "water of the bar, against the stiff current, which latter tripped their\r\n",
      "legs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the fun.\r\n",
      "And now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in each\r\n",
      "other’s faces with their palms, gradually approaching each other, with\r\n",
      "averted faces to avoid the strangling sprays, and finally gripping and\r\n",
      "struggling till the best man ducked his neighbor, and then they all\r\n",
      "went under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing,\r\n",
      "sputtering, laughing, and gasping for breath at one and the same time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When they were well exhausted, they would run out and sprawl on the dry,\r\n",
      "hot sand, and lie there and cover themselves up with it, and by and by\r\n",
      "break for the water again and go through the original performance once\r\n",
      "more. Finally it occurred to them that their naked skin represented\r\n",
      "flesh-colored “tights” very fairly; so they drew a ring in the sand and\r\n",
      "had a circus—with three clowns in it, for none would yield this proudest\r\n",
      "post to his neighbor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Next they got their marbles and played “knucks” and “ringtaw” and\r\n",
      "“keeps” till that amusement grew stale. Then Joe and Huck had another\r\n",
      "swim, but Tom would not venture, because he found that in kicking off\r\n",
      "his trousers he had kicked his string of rattlesnake rattles off his\r\n",
      "ankle, and he wondered how he had escaped cramp so long without the\r\n",
      "protection of this mysterious charm. He did not venture again until he\r\n",
      "had found it, and by that time the other boys were tired and ready to\r\n",
      "rest. They gradually wandered apart, dropped into the “dumps,” and\r\n",
      "fell to gazing longingly across the wide river to where the village lay\r\n",
      "drowsing in the sun. Tom found himself writing “BECKY” in the sand with\r\n",
      "his big toe; he scratched it out, and was angry with himself for his\r\n",
      "weakness. But he wrote it again, nevertheless; he could not help it. He\r\n",
      "erased it once more and then took himself out of temptation by driving\r\n",
      "the other boys together and joining them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Joe’s spirits had gone down almost beyond resurrection. He was so\r\n",
      "homesick that he could hardly endure the misery of it. The tears lay\r\n",
      "very near the surface. Huck was melancholy, too. Tom was downhearted,\r\n",
      "but tried hard not to show it. He had a secret which he was not ready\r\n",
      "to tell, yet, but if this mutinous depression was not broken up soon, he\r\n",
      "would have to bring it out. He said, with a great show of cheerfulness:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I bet there’s been pirates on this island before, boys. We’ll explore\r\n",
      "it again. They’ve hid treasures here somewhere. How’d you feel to light\r\n",
      "on a rotten chest full of gold and silver—hey?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But it roused only faint enthusiasm, which faded out, with no reply.\r\n",
      "Tom tried one or two other seductions; but they failed, too. It was\r\n",
      "discouraging work. Joe sat poking up the sand with a stick and looking\r\n",
      "very gloomy. Finally he said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, boys, let’s give it up. I want to go home. It’s so lonesome.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh no, Joe, you’ll feel better by and by,” said Tom. “Just think of the\r\n",
      "fishing that’s here.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t care for fishing. I want to go home.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But, Joe, there ain’t such another swimming-place anywhere.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Swimming’s no good. I don’t seem to care for it, somehow, when there\r\n",
      "ain’t anybody to say I sha’n’t go in. I mean to go home.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, shucks! Baby! You want to see your mother, I reckon.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I _do_ want to see my mother—and you would, too, if you had one. I\r\n",
      "ain’t any more baby than you are.” And Joe snuffled a little.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, we’ll let the crybaby go home to his mother, won’t we, Huck? Poor\r\n",
      "thing—does it want to see its mother? And so it shall. You like it here,\r\n",
      "don’t you, Huck? We’ll stay, won’t we?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Huck said, “Y-e-s”—without any heart in it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ll never speak to you again as long as I live,” said Joe, rising.\r\n",
      "“There now!” And he moved moodily away and began to dress himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who cares!” said Tom. “Nobody wants you to. Go ’long home and get\r\n",
      "laughed at. Oh, you’re a nice pirate. Huck and me ain’t crybabies. We’ll\r\n",
      "stay, won’t we, Huck? Let him go if he wants to. I reckon we can get\r\n",
      "along without him, per’aps.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Tom was uneasy, nevertheless, and was alarmed to see Joe go sullenly\r\n",
      "on with his dressing. And then it was discomforting to see Huck eying\r\n",
      "Joe’s preparations so wistfully, and keeping up such an ominous silence.\r\n",
      "Presently, without a parting word, Joe began to wade off toward the\r\n",
      "Illinois shore. Tom’s heart began to sink. He glanced at Huck. Huck\r\n",
      "could not bear the look, and dropped his eyes. Then he said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I want to go, too, Tom. It was getting so lonesome anyway, and now\r\n",
      "it’ll be worse. Let’s us go, too, Tom.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I won’t! You can all go, if you want to. I mean to stay.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tom, I better go.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, go ’long—who’s hendering you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Huck began to pick up his scattered clothes. He said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tom, I wisht you’d come, too. Now you think it over. We’ll wait for you\r\n",
      "when we get to shore.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, you’ll wait a blame long time, that’s all.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Huck started sorrowfully away, and Tom stood looking after him, with a\r\n",
      "strong desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride and go along\r\n",
      "too. He hoped the boys would stop, but they still waded slowly on. It\r\n",
      "suddenly dawned on Tom that it was become very lonely and still. He made\r\n",
      "one final struggle with his pride, and then darted after his comrades,\r\n",
      "yelling:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Wait! Wait! I want to tell you something!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They presently stopped and turned around. When he got to where they\r\n",
      "were, he began unfolding his secret, and they listened moodily till\r\n",
      "at last they saw the “point” he was driving at, and then they set up a\r\n",
      "warwhoop of applause and said it was “splendid!” and said if he had\r\n",
      "told them at first, they wouldn’t have started away. He made a plausible\r\n",
      "excuse; but his real reason had been the fear that not even the secret\r\n",
      "would keep them with him any very great length of time, and so he had\r\n",
      "meant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a will,\r\n",
      "chattering all the time about Tom’s stupendous plan and admiring the\r\n",
      "genius of it. After a dainty egg and fish dinner, Tom said he wanted to\r\n",
      "learn to smoke, now. Joe caught at the idea and said he would like to\r\n",
      "try, too. So Huck made pipes and filled them. These novices had never\r\n",
      "smoked anything before but cigars made of grapevine, and they “bit” the\r\n",
      "tongue, and were not considered manly anyway.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff,\r\n",
      "charily, and with slender confidence. The smoke had an unpleasant taste,\r\n",
      "and they gagged a little, but Tom said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, it’s just as easy! If I’d a knowed this was all, I’d a learnt long\r\n",
      "ago.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So would I,” said Joe. “It’s just nothing.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, many a time I’ve looked at people smoking, and thought well I wish\r\n",
      "I could do that; but I never thought I could,” said Tom.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s just the way with me, hain’t it, Huck? You’ve heard me talk just\r\n",
      "that way—haven’t you, Huck? I’ll leave it to Huck if I haven’t.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes—heaps of times,” said Huck.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, I have too,” said Tom; “oh, hundreds of times. Once down by the\r\n",
      "slaughter-house. Don’t you remember, Huck? Bob Tanner was there, and\r\n",
      "Johnny Miller, and Jeff Thatcher, when I said it. Don’t you remember,\r\n",
      "Huck, ’bout me saying that?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, that’s so,” said Huck. “That was the day after I lost a white\r\n",
      "alley. No, ’twas the day before.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There—I told you so,” said Tom. “Huck recollects it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I bleeve I could smoke this pipe all day,” said Joe. “I don’t feel\r\n",
      "sick.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Neither do I,” said Tom. “I could smoke it all day. But I bet you Jeff\r\n",
      "Thatcher couldn’t.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Jeff Thatcher! Why, he’d keel over just with two draws. Just let him\r\n",
      "try it once. _He’d_ see!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I bet he would. And Johnny Miller—I wish could see Johnny Miller tackle\r\n",
      "it once.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, don’t I!” said Joe. “Why, I bet you Johnny Miller couldn’t any more\r\n",
      "do this than nothing. Just one little snifter would fetch _him_.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“’Deed it would, Joe. Say—I wish the boys could see us now.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So do I.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Say—boys, don’t say anything about it, and some time when they’re\r\n",
      "around, I’ll come up to you and say, ‘Joe, got a pipe? I want a smoke.’\r\n",
      "And you’ll say, kind of careless like, as if it warn’t anything, you’ll\r\n",
      "say, ‘Yes, I got my _old_ pipe, and another one, but my tobacker ain’t\r\n",
      "very good.’ And I’ll say, ‘Oh, that’s all right, if it’s _strong_\r\n",
      "enough.’ And then you’ll out with the pipes, and we’ll light up just as\r\n",
      "ca’m, and then just see ’em look!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“By jings, that’ll be gay, Tom! I wish it was _now_!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So do I! And when we tell ’em we learned when we was off pirating,\r\n",
      "won’t they wish they’d been along?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, I reckon not! I’ll just _bet_ they will!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So the talk ran on. But presently it began to flag a trifle, and\r\n",
      "grow disjointed. The silences widened; the expectoration marvellously\r\n",
      "increased. Every pore inside the boys’ cheeks became a spouting\r\n",
      "fountain; they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues\r\n",
      "fast enough to prevent an inundation; little overflowings down their\r\n",
      "throats occurred in spite of all they could do, and sudden retchings\r\n",
      "followed every time. Both boys were looking very pale and miserable,\r\n",
      "now. Joe’s pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers. Tom’s followed. Both\r\n",
      "fountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and\r\n",
      "main. Joe said feebly:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ve lost my knife. I reckon I better go and find it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom said, with quivering lips and halting utterance:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ll help you. You go over that way and I’ll hunt around by the spring.\r\n",
      "No, you needn’t come, Huck—we can find it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So Huck sat down again, and waited an hour. Then he found it lonesome,\r\n",
      "and went to find his comrades. They were wide apart in the woods, both\r\n",
      "very pale, both fast asleep. But something informed him that if they had\r\n",
      "had any trouble they had got rid of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They were not talkative at supper that night. They had a humble look,\r\n",
      "and when Huck prepared his pipe after the meal and was going to prepare\r\n",
      "theirs, they said no, they were not feeling very well—something they ate\r\n",
      "at dinner had disagreed with them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "About midnight Joe awoke, and called the boys. There was a brooding\r\n",
      "oppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something. The boys\r\n",
      "huddled themselves together and sought the friendly companionship of\r\n",
      "the fire, though the dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere was\r\n",
      "stifling. They sat still, intent and waiting. The solemn hush continued.\r\n",
      "Beyond the light of the fire everything was swallowed up in the\r\n",
      "blackness of darkness. Presently there came a quivering glow that\r\n",
      "vaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then vanished. By and by\r\n",
      "another came, a little stronger. Then another. Then a faint moan came\r\n",
      "sighing through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting\r\n",
      "breath upon their cheeks, and shuddered with the fancy that the Spirit\r\n",
      "of the Night had gone by. There was a pause. Now a weird flash turned\r\n",
      "night into day and showed every little grassblade, separate and\r\n",
      "distinct, that grew about their feet. And it showed three white,\r\n",
      "startled faces, too. A deep peal of thunder went rolling and tumbling\r\n",
      "down the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the distance. A\r\n",
      "sweep of chilly air passed by, rustling all the leaves and snowing the\r\n",
      "flaky ashes broadcast about the fire. Another fierce glare lit up the\r\n",
      "forest and an instant crash followed that seemed to rend the treetops\r\n",
      "right over the boys’ heads. They clung together in terror, in the thick\r\n",
      "gloom that followed. A few big raindrops fell pattering upon the leaves.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Quick! boys, go for the tent!” exclaimed Tom.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They sprang away, stumbling over roots and among vines in the dark, no\r\n",
      "two plunging in the same direction. A furious blast roared through\r\n",
      "the trees, making everything sing as it went. One blinding flash after\r\n",
      "another came, and peal on peal of deafening thunder. And now a drenching\r\n",
      "rain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the\r\n",
      "ground. The boys cried out to each other, but the roaring wind and the\r\n",
      "booming thunderblasts drowned their voices utterly. However, one by one\r\n",
      "they straggled in at last and took shelter under the tent, cold, scared,\r\n",
      "and streaming with water; but to have company in misery seemed something\r\n",
      "to be grateful for. They could not talk, the old sail flapped so\r\n",
      "furiously, even if the other noises would have allowed them. The tempest\r\n",
      "rose higher and higher, and presently the sail tore loose from its\r\n",
      "fastenings and went winging away on the blast. The boys seized each\r\n",
      "others’ hands and fled, with many tumblings and bruises, to the shelter\r\n",
      "of a great oak that stood upon the riverbank. Now the battle was at its\r\n",
      "highest. Under the ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed\r\n",
      "in the skies, everything below stood out in cleancut and shadowless\r\n",
      "distinctness: the bending trees, the billowy river, white with foam, the\r\n",
      "driving spray of spumeflakes, the dim outlines of the high bluffs on\r\n",
      "the other side, glimpsed through the drifting cloudrack and the slanting\r\n",
      "veil of rain. Every little while some giant tree yielded the fight\r\n",
      "and fell crashing through the younger growth; and the unflagging\r\n",
      "thunderpeals came now in ear-splitting explosive bursts, keen and sharp,\r\n",
      "and unspeakably appalling. The storm culminated in one matchless effort\r\n",
      "that seemed likely to tear the island to pieces, burn it up, drown it to\r\n",
      "the treetops, blow it away, and deafen every creature in it, all at one\r\n",
      "and the same moment. It was a wild night for homeless young heads to be\r\n",
      "out in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But at last the battle was done, and the forces retired with weaker and\r\n",
      "weaker threatenings and grumblings, and peace resumed her sway. The\r\n",
      "boys went back to camp, a good deal awed; but they found there was still\r\n",
      "something to be thankful for, because the great sycamore, the shelter\r\n",
      "of their beds, was a ruin, now, blasted by the lightnings, and they were\r\n",
      "not under it when the catastrophe happened.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Everything in camp was drenched, the campfire as well; for they were but\r\n",
      "heedless lads, like their generation, and had made no provision against\r\n",
      "rain. Here was matter for dismay, for they were soaked through and\r\n",
      "chilled. They were eloquent in their distress; but they presently\r\n",
      "discovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had\r\n",
      "been built against (where it curved upward and separated itself from\r\n",
      "the ground), that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting; so they\r\n",
      "patiently wrought until, with shreds and bark gathered from the under\r\n",
      "sides of sheltered logs, they coaxed the fire to burn again. Then they\r\n",
      "piled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace, and were\r\n",
      "gladhearted once more. They dried their boiled ham and had a feast,\r\n",
      "and after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their\r\n",
      "midnight adventure until morning, for there was not a dry spot to sleep\r\n",
      "on, anywhere around.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As the sun began to steal in upon the boys, drowsiness came over\r\n",
      "them, and they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep. They got\r\n",
      "scorched out by and by, and drearily set about getting breakfast. After\r\n",
      "the meal they felt rusty, and stiff-jointed, and a little homesick once\r\n",
      "more. Tom saw the signs, and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as\r\n",
      "he could. But they cared nothing for marbles, or circus, or swimming, or\r\n",
      "anything. He reminded them of the imposing secret, and raised a ray of\r\n",
      "cheer. While it lasted, he got them interested in a new device. This was\r\n",
      "to knock off being pirates, for a while, and be Indians for a change.\r\n",
      "They were attracted by this idea; so it was not long before they were\r\n",
      "stripped, and striped from head to heel with black mud, like so many\r\n",
      "zebras—all of them chiefs, of course—and then they went tearing through\r\n",
      "the woods to attack an English settlement.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By and by they separated into three hostile tribes, and darted upon each\r\n",
      "other from ambush with dreadful warwhoops, and killed and scalped each\r\n",
      "other by thousands. It was a gory day. Consequently it was an extremely\r\n",
      "satisfactory one.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They assembled in camp toward suppertime, hungry and happy; but now\r\n",
      "a difficulty arose—hostile Indians could not break the bread of\r\n",
      "hospitality together without first making peace, and this was a simple\r\n",
      "impossibility without smoking a pipe of peace. There was no other\r\n",
      "process that ever they had heard of. Two of the savages almost wished\r\n",
      "they had remained pirates. However, there was no other way; so with such\r\n",
      "show of cheerfulness as they could muster they called for the pipe and\r\n",
      "took their whiff as it passed, in due form.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And behold, they were glad they had gone into savagery, for they had\r\n",
      "gained something; they found that they could now smoke a little without\r\n",
      "having to go and hunt for a lost knife; they did not get sick enough to\r\n",
      "be seriously uncomfortable. They were not likely to fool away this high\r\n",
      "promise for lack of effort. No, they practised cautiously, after supper,\r\n",
      "with right fair success, and so they spent a jubilant evening. They were\r\n",
      "prouder and happier in their new acquirement than they would have been\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "This thought broke her down, and she wandered away, with tears rolling\r\n",
      "down her cheeks. Then quite a group of boys and girls—playmates of Tom’s\r\n",
      "and Joe’s—came by, and stood looking over the paling fence and talking\r\n",
      "in reverent tones of how Tom did so-and-so the last time they saw\r\n",
      "him, and how Joe said this and that small trifle (pregnant with awful\r\n",
      "prophecy, as they could easily see now!)—and each speaker pointed out\r\n",
      "the exact spot where the lost lads stood at the time, and then added\r\n",
      "something like “and I was a-standing just so—just as I am now, and as if\r\n",

      "who _did_ see the departed last, and exchanged the last words with them,\r\n",
      "the lucky parties took upon themselves a sort of sacred importance,\r\n",
      "and were gaped at and envied by all the rest. One poor chap, who had\r\n",

      "When the Sunday-school hour was finished, the next morning, the bell\r\n",
      "began to toll, instead of ringing in the usual way. It was a very still\r\n",
      "Sabbath, and the mournful sound seemed in keeping with the musing hush\r\n",
      "that lay upon nature. The villagers began to gather, loitering a moment\r\n",
      "in the vestibule to converse in whispers about the sad event. But there\r\n",
      "was no whispering in the house; only the funereal rustling of dresses\r\n",

      "entered, followed by Sid and Mary, and they by the Harper family, all in\r\n",
      "deep black, and the whole congregation, the old minister as well, rose\r\n",
      "reverently and stood until the mourners were seated in the front pew.\r\n",
      "There was another communing silence, broken at intervals by muffled\r\n",

      "in remembering that he had persistently blinded himself to them always\r\n",
      "before, and had as persistently seen only faults and flaws in the poor\r\n",
      "boys. The minister related many a touching incident in the lives of the\r\n",
      "departed, too, which illustrated their sweet, generous natures, and the\r\n",
      "people could easily see, now, how noble and beautiful those episodes\r\n",
      "were, and remembered with grief that at the time they occurred they had\r\n",

      "of eyes followed the minister’s, and then almost with one impulse the\r\n",
      "congregation rose and stared while the three dead boys came marching up\r\n",
      "the aisle, Tom in the lead, Joe next, and Huck, a ruin of drooping rags,\r\n",

      "to do or where to hide from so many unwelcoming eyes. He wavered, and\r\n",
      "started to slink away, but Tom seized him and said:\r\n",

      "came to her eyes; she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went on\r\n",
      "chattering, but the life had gone out of the picnic, now, and out of\r\n",
      "everything else; she got away as soon as she could and hid herself and\r\n",

      "falling of his mercury. She was sitting cosily on a little bench behind\r\n",
      "the schoolhouse looking at a picture-book with Alfred Temple—and so\r\n",
      "absorbed were they, and their heads so close together over the book,\r\n",

      "Jealousy ran red-hot through Tom’s veins. He began to hate himself for\r\n",
      "throwing away the chance Becky had offered for a reconciliation. He\r\n",
      "called himself a fool, and all the hard names he could think of. He\r\n",
      "wanted to cry with vexation. Amy chatted happily along, as they walked,\r\n",
      "for her heart was singing, but Tom’s tongue had lost its function. He\r\n",
      "did not hear what Amy was saying, and whenever she paused expectantly\r\n",
      "he could only stammer an awkward assent, which was as often misplaced\r\n",
      "as otherwise. He kept drifting to the rear of the schoolhouse, again and\r\n",
      "again, to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there. He could\r\n",
      "not help it. And it maddened him to see, as he thought he saw, that\r\n",
      "Becky Thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of the\r\n",
      "living. But she did see, nevertheless; and she knew she was winning her\r\n",
      "fight, too, and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Amy’s happy prattle became intolerable. Tom hinted at things he had\r\n",
      "to attend to; things that must be done; and time was fleeting. But in\r\n",
      "vain—the girl chirped on. Tom thought, “Oh, hang her, ain’t I ever going\r\n",
      "to get rid of her?” At last he must be attending to those things—and she\r\n",
      "said artlessly that she would be “around” when school let out. And he\r\n",
      "hastened away, hating her for it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Any other boy!” Tom thought, grating his teeth. “Any boy in the whole\r\n",
      "town but that Saint Louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and is\r\n",
      "aristocracy! Oh, all right, I licked you the first day you ever saw this\r\n",

      "out! I’ll just take and—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy—pummelling\r\n",
      "the air, and kicking and gouging. “Oh, you do, do you? You holler\r\n",
      "’nough, do you? Now, then, let that learn you!” And so the imaginary\r\n",
      "flogging was finished to his satisfaction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom fled home at noon. His conscience could not endure any more of Amy’s\r\n",
      "grateful happiness, and his jealousy could bear no more of the other\r\n",
      "distress. Becky resumed her picture inspections with Alfred, but as the\r\n",
      "minutes dragged along and no Tom came to suffer, her triumph began to\r\n",
      "cloud and she lost interest; gravity and absentmindedness followed,\r\n",
      "and then melancholy; two or three times she pricked up her ear at\r\n",
      "a footstep, but it was a false hope; no Tom came. At last she grew\r\n",
      "entirely miserable and wished she hadn’t carried it so far. When\r\n",
      "poor Alfred, seeing that he was losing her, he did not know how, kept\r\n",
      "exclaiming: “Oh, here’s a jolly one! look at this!” she lost patience at\r\n",
      "last, and said, “Oh, don’t bother me! I don’t care for them!” and burst\r\n",
      "into tears, and got up and walked away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Alfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her, but she\r\n",
      "said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Go away and leave me alone, can’t you! I hate you!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So the boy halted, wondering what he could have done—for she had said\r\n",
      "she would look at pictures all through the nooning—and she walked on,\r\n",
      "crying. Then Alfred went musing into the deserted schoolhouse. He was\r\n",
      "humiliated and angry. He easily guessed his way to the truth—the girl\r\n",
      "had simply made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon Tom Sawyer.\r\n",
      "He was far from hating Tom the less when this thought occurred to him.\r\n",
      "He wished there was some way to get that boy into trouble without much\r\n",
      "risk to himself. Tom’s spelling-book fell under his eye. Here was his\r\n",
      "opportunity. He gratefully opened to the lesson for the afternoon and\r\n",
      "poured ink upon the page.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Becky, glancing in at a window behind him at the moment, saw the act,\r\n",

      "THERE was something about Aunt Polly’s manner, when she kissed Tom, that\r\n",
      "swept away his low spirits and made him lighthearted and happy again. He\r\n",
      "started to school and had the luck of coming upon Becky Thatcher at the\r\n",
      "head of Meadow Lane. His mood always determined his manner. Without a\r\n",
      "moment’s hesitation he ran to her and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I acted mighty mean today, Becky, and I’m so sorry. I won’t ever, ever\r\n",
      "do that way again, as long as ever I live—please make up, won’t you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face:\r\n",

      "never speak to you again.”\r\n",

      "She tossed her head and passed on. Tom was so stunned that he had not\r\n",
      "even presence of mind enough to say “Who cares, Miss Smarty?” until the\r\n",
      "right time to say it had gone by. So he said nothing. But he was in a\r\n",
      "fine rage, nevertheless. He moped into the schoolyard wishing she were\r\n",
      "a boy, and imagining how he would trounce her if she were. He presently\r\n",
      "encountered her and delivered a stinging remark as he passed. She hurled\r\n",
      "one in return, and the angry breach was complete. It seemed to Becky, in\r\n",
      "her hot resentment, that she could hardly wait for school to “take in,”\r\n",
      " she was so impatient to see Tom flogged for the injured spelling-book.\r\n",
      "If she had had any lingering notion of exposing Alfred Temple, Tom’s\r\n",
      "offensive fling had driven it entirely away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Poor girl, she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble herself.\r\n",
      "The master, Mr. Dobbins, had reached middle age with an unsatisfied\r\n",
      "ambition. The darling of his desires was, to be a doctor, but\r\n",
      "poverty had decreed that he should be nothing higher than a village\r\n",
      "schoolmaster. Every day he took a mysterious book out of his desk and\r\n",
      "absorbed himself in it at times when no classes were reciting. He kept\r\n",
      "that book under lock and key. There was not an urchin in school but was\r\n",
      "perishing to have a glimpse of it, but the chance never came. Every boy\r\n",
      "and girl had a theory about the nature of that book; but no two theories\r\n",
      "were alike, and there was no way of getting at the facts in the case.\r\n",
      "Now, as Becky was passing by the desk, which stood near the door, she\r\n",
      "noticed that the key was in the lock! It was a precious moment. She\r\n",
      "glanced around; found herself alone, and the next instant she had the\r\n",
      "book in her hands. The titlepage—Professor Somebody’s _Anatomy_—carried\r\n",
      "no information to her mind; so she began to turn the leaves. She came at\r\n",
      "once upon a handsomely engraved and colored frontispiece—a human figure,\r\n",
      "stark naked. At that moment a shadow fell on the page and Tom Sawyer\r\n",
      "stepped in at the door and caught a glimpse of the picture. Becky\r\n",
      "snatched at the book to close it, and had the hard luck to tear the\r\n",
      "pictured page half down the middle. She thrust the volume into the desk,\r\n",
      "turned the key, and burst out crying with shame and vexation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tom Sawyer, you are just as mean as you can be, to sneak up on a person\r\n",
      "and look at what they’re looking at.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How could I know you was looking at anything?”\r\n",

      "whipped, and I never was whipped in school.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "“_Be_ so mean if you want to! I know something that’s going to happen.\r\n",
      "You just wait and you’ll see! Hateful, hateful, hateful!”—and she flung\r\n",
      "out of the house with a new explosion of crying.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom stood still, rather flustered by this onslaught. Presently he said\r\n",
      "to himself:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What a curious kind of a fool a girl is! Never been licked in\r\n",
      "school! Shucks! What’s a licking! That’s just like a girl—they’re so\r\n",
      "thin-skinned and chicken-hearted. Well, of course I ain’t going to tell\r\n",
      "old Dobbins on this little fool, because there’s other ways of getting\r\n",
      "even on her, that ain’t so mean; but what of it? Old Dobbins will ask\r\n",
      "who it was tore his book. Nobody’ll answer. Then he’ll do just the way\r\n",
      "he always does—ask first one and then t’other, and when he comes to the\r\n",
      "right girl he’ll know it, without any telling. Girls’ faces always tell\r\n",
      "on them. They ain’t got any backbone. She’ll get licked. Well, it’s a\r\n",
      "kind of a tight place for Becky Thatcher, because there ain’t any way\r\n",
      "out of it.” Tom conned the thing a moment longer, and then added: “All\r\n",
      "right, though; she’d like to see me in just such a fix—let her sweat it\r\n",
      "out!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside. In a few moments the\r\n",
      "master arrived and school “took in.” Tom did not feel a strong interest\r\n",
      "in his studies. Every time he stole a glance at the girls’ side of the\r\n",
      "room Becky’s face troubled him. Considering all things, he did not want\r\n",
      "to pity her, and yet it was all he could do to help it. He could get\r\n",
      "up no exultation that was really worthy the name. Presently the\r\n",
      "spelling-book discovery was made, and Tom’s mind was entirely full\r\n",
      "of his own matters for a while after that. Becky roused up from her\r\n",
      "lethargy of distress and showed good interest in the proceedings. She\r\n",
      "did not expect that Tom could get out of his trouble by denying that he\r\n",
      "spilt the ink on the book himself; and she was right. The denial only\r\n",
      "seemed to make the thing worse for Tom. Becky supposed she would be glad\r\n",
      "of that, and she tried to believe she was glad of it, but she found she\r\n",
      "was not certain. When the worst came to the worst, she had an impulse\r\n",
      "to get up and tell on Alfred Temple, but she made an effort and forced\r\n",
      "herself to keep still—because, said she to herself, “he’ll tell about me\r\n",
      "tearing the picture sure. I wouldn’t say a word, not to save his life!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all\r\n",
      "broken-hearted, for he thought it was possible that he had unknowingly\r\n",
      "upset the ink on the spelling-book himself, in some skylarking bout—he\r\n",
      "had denied it for form’s sake and because it was custom, and had stuck\r\n",
      "to the denial from principle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A whole hour drifted by, the master sat nodding in his throne, the air\r\n",
      "was drowsy with the hum of study. By and by, Mr. Dobbins straightened\r\n",
      "himself up, yawned, then unlocked his desk, and reached for his book,\r\n",
      "but seemed undecided whether to take it out or leave it. Most of the\r\n",
      "pupils glanced up languidly, but there were two among them that watched\r\n",
      "his movements with intent eyes. Mr. Dobbins fingered his book absently\r\n",
      "for a while, then took it out and settled himself in his chair to read!\r\n",
      "Tom shot a glance at Becky. He had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit\r\n",
      "look as she did, with a gun levelled at its head. Instantly he forgot\r\n",
      "his quarrel with her. Quick—something must be done! done in a flash,\r\n",
      "too! But the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention.\r\n",
      "Good!—he had an inspiration! He would run and snatch the book, spring\r\n",
      "through the door and fly. But his resolution shook for one little\r\n",
      "instant, and the chance was lost—the master opened the volume. If Tom\r\n",
      "only had the wasted opportunity back again! Too late. There was no help\r\n",
      "for Becky now, he said. The next moment the master faced the school.\r\n",
      "Every eye sank under his gaze. There was that in it which smote even\r\n",
      "the innocent with fear. There was silence while one might count ten—the\r\n",
      "master was gathering his wrath. Then he spoke: “Who tore this book?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was not a sound. One could have heard a pin drop. The stillness\r\n",
      "continued; the master searched face after face for signs of guilt.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Benjamin Rogers, did you tear this book?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A denial. Another pause.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Joseph Harper, did you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another denial. Tom’s uneasiness grew more and more intense under the\r\n",
      "slow torture of these proceedings. The master scanned the ranks of\r\n",
      "boys—considered a while, then turned to the girls:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Amy Lawrence?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A shake of the head.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The same sign.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Susan Harper, did you do this?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another negative. The next girl was Becky Thatcher. Tom was trembling\r\n",
      "from head to foot with excitement and a sense of the hopelessness of the\r\n",
      "situation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Rebecca Thatcher” [Tom glanced at her face—it was white with\r\n",

      "appeal]—“did you tear this book?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A thought shot like lightning through Tom’s brain. He sprang to his feet\r\n",
      "and shouted—“I done it!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly. Tom stood a\r\n",

      "shone upon him out of poor Becky’s eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred\r\n",
      "floggings. Inspired by the splendor of his own act, he took without\r\n",
      "an outcry the most merciless flaying that even Mr. Dobbins had ever\r\n",
      "administered; and also received with indifference the added cruelty of a\r\n",
      "command to remain two hours after school should be dismissed—for he\r\n",

      "VACATION was approaching. The schoolmaster, always severe, grew severer\r\n",
      "and more exacting than ever, for he wanted the school to make a good\r\n",
      "showing on “Examination” day. His rod and his ferule were seldom idle\r\n",
      "now—at least among the smaller pupils. Only the biggest boys, and young\r\n",
      "ladies of eighteen and twenty, escaped lashing. Mr. Dobbins’ lashings\r\n",
      "were very vigorous ones, too; for although he carried, under his wig, a\r\n",
      "perfectly bald and shiny head, he had only reached middle age, and there\r\n",
      "was no sign of feebleness in his muscle. As the great day approached,\r\n",
      "all the tyranny that was in him came to the surface; he seemed to take a\r\n",
      "vindictive pleasure in punishing the least shortcomings. The consequence\r\n",
      "was, that the smaller boys spent their days in terror and suffering and\r\n",
      "their nights in plotting revenge. They threw away no opportunity to do\r\n",
      "the master a mischief. But he kept ahead all the time. The retribution\r\n",
      "that followed every vengeful success was so sweeping and majestic that\r\n",
      "the boys always retired from the field badly worsted. At last they\r\n",
      "conspired together and hit upon a plan that promised a dazzling victory.\r\n",
      "They swore in the signpainter’s boy, told him the scheme, and asked his\r\n",
      "help. He had his own reasons for being delighted, for the master boarded\r\n",
      "in his father’s family and had given the boy ample cause to hate him.\r\n",
      "The master’s wife would go on a visit to the country in a few days, and\r\n",
      "there would be nothing to interfere with the plan; the master always\r\n",
      "prepared himself for great occasions by getting pretty well fuddled, and\r\n",
      "the signpainter’s boy said that when the dominie had reached the proper\r\n",
      "condition on Examination Evening he would “manage the thing” while he\r\n",

      "small boys, washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort;\r\n",
      "rows of gawky big boys; snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in\r\n",
      "lawn and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms, their\r\n",
      "grandmothers’ ancient trinkets, their bits of pink and blue ribbon and\r\n",

      "trifle out of order. But he got through safely, though cruelly scared,\r\n",

      "middle of it. A ghastly stage-fright seized him, his legs quaked under\r\n",

      "and phrases until they were worn entirely out; and a peculiarity that\r\n",
      "conspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerable\r\n",
      "sermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every one\r\n",
      "of them. No matter what the subject might be, a brainracking effort was\r\n",
      "made to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and religious\r\n",
      "mind could contemplate with edification. The glaring insincerity of\r\n",
      "these sermons was not sufficient to compass the banishment of the\r\n",
      "fashion from the schools, and it is not sufficient today; it never will\r\n",
      "be sufficient while the world stands, perhaps. There is no school in\r\n",

      "most frivolous and the least religious girl in the school is always\r\n",

      "TOM joined the new order of Cadets of Temperance, being attracted by the\r\n",
      "showy character of their “regalia.” He promised to abstain from smoking,\r\n",
      "chewing, and profanity as long as he remained a member. Now he found out\r\n",
      "a new thing—namely, that to promise not to do a thing is the surest way\r\n",
      "in the world to make a body want to go and do that very thing. Tom soon\r\n",
      "found himself tormented with a desire to drink and swear; the desire\r\n",
      "grew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of a chance to display\r\n",
      "himself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing from the order. Fourth\r\n",
      "of July was coming; but he soon gave that up—gave it up before he had\r\n",
      "worn his shackles over forty-eight hours—and fixed his hopes upon old\r\n",
      "Judge Frazer, justice of the peace, who was apparently on his deathbed\r\n",
      "and would have a big public funeral, since he was so high an official.\r\n",
      "During three days Tom was deeply concerned about the Judge’s condition\r\n",

      "he would venture to get out his regalia and practise before the\r\n",
      "looking-glass. But the Judge had a most discouraging way of fluctuating.\r\n",
      "At last he was pronounced upon the mend—and then convalescent. Tom was\r\n",
      "disgusted; and felt a sense of injury, too. He handed in his resignation\r\n",

      "He believed he had taxed the forbearance of the powers above to the\r\n",
      "extremity of endurance and that this was the result. It might have\r\n",
      "seemed to him a waste of pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with a\r\n",
      "battery of artillery, but there seemed nothing incongruous about the\r\n",
      "getting up such an expensive thunderstorm as this to knock the turf from\r\n",

      "“Blame it, we must be in the wrong place again. What do you think?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is mighty curious, Huck. I don’t understand it. Sometimes witches\r\n",
      "interfere. I reckon maybe that’s what’s the trouble now.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Shucks! Witches ain’t got no power in the daytime.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, that’s so. I didn’t think of that. Oh, I know what the matter is!\r\n",
      "What a blamed lot of fools we are! You got to find out where the shadow\r\n",
      "of the limb falls at midnight, and that’s where you dig!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then consound it, we’ve fooled away all this work for nothing. Now hang\r\n",

      "you get out?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I bet I will. We’ve got to do it tonight, too, because if somebody sees\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The boys were there that night, about the appointed time. They sat in\r\n",
      "the shadow waiting. It was a lonely place, and an hour made solemn by\r\n",
      "old traditions. Spirits whispered in the rustling leaves, ghosts lurked\r\n",
      "in the murky nooks, the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the\r\n",
      "distance, an owl answered with his sepulchral note. The boys were\r\n",
      "subdued by these solemnities, and talked little. By and by they judged\r\n",
      "that twelve had come; they marked where the shadow fell, and began to\r\n",
      "dig. Their hopes commenced to rise. Their interest grew stronger, and\r\n",
      "their industry kept pace with it. The hole deepened and still deepened,\r\n",
      "but every time their hearts jumped to hear the pick strike upon\r\n",
      "something, they only suffered a new disappointment. It was only a stone\r\n",
      "or a chunk. At last Tom said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It ain’t any use, Huck, we’re wrong again.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, but we _can’t_ be wrong. We spotted the shadder to a dot.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“What’s that?”.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "up. We can’t ever tell the right time, and besides this kind of thing’s\r\n",
      "too awful, here this time of night with witches and ghosts a-fluttering\r\n",
      "around so. I feel as if something’s behind me all the time; and I’m\r\n",
      "afeard to turn around, becuz maybe there’s others in front a-waiting for\r\n",
      "a chance. I been creeping all over, ever since I got here.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "ABOUT noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree; they had come\r\n",
      "for their tools. Tom was impatient to go to the haunted house; Huck was\r\n",
      "measurably so, also—but suddenly said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Lookyhere, Tom, do you know what day it is?”\r\n",

      "“My! I never once thought of it, Huck!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, I didn’t neither, but all at once it popped onto me that it was\r\n",
      "Friday.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Blame it, a body can’t be too careful, Huck. We might ’a’ got into an\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“_Might_! Better say we _would_! There’s some lucky days, maybe, but\r\n",
      "Friday ain’t.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Well, I never said I was, did I? And Friday ain’t all, neither. I had a\r\n",

      "there’s trouble around, you know. All we got to do is to look mighty\r\n",
      "sharp and keep out of it. We’ll drop this thing for today, and play. Do\r\n",
      "you know Robin Hood, Huck?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No. Who’s Robin Hood?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, he was one of the greatest men that was ever in England—and the\r\n",
      "best. He was a robber.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Cracky, I wisht I was. Who did he rob?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings, and such like. But\r\n",
      "he never bothered the poor. He loved ’em. He always divided up with ’em\r\n",
      "perfectly square.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, he must ’a’ been a brick.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I bet you he was, Huck. Oh, he was the noblest man that ever was.\r\n",
      "They ain’t any such men now, I can tell you. He could lick any man in\r\n",
      "England, with one hand tied behind him; and he could take his yew bow\r\n",
      "and plug a ten-cent piece every time, a mile and a half.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What’s a _yew_ bow?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t know. It’s some kind of a bow, of course. And if he hit that\r\n",
      "dime only on the edge he would set down and cry—and curse. But we’ll\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I’m agreed.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So they played Robin Hood all the afternoon, now and then casting a\r\n",
      "yearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the\r\n",
      "morrow’s prospects and possibilities there. As the sun began to sink\r\n",
      "into the west they took their way homeward athwart the long shadows\r\n",
      "of the trees and soon were buried from sight in the forests of Cardiff\r\n",
      "Hill.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On Saturday, shortly after noon, the boys were at the dead tree again.\r\n",
      "They had a smoke and a chat in the shade, and then dug a little in their\r\n",
      "last hole, not with great hope, but merely because Tom said there were\r\n",
      "so many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting down\r\n",
      "within six inches of it, and then somebody else had come along and\r\n",
      "turned it up with a single thrust of a shovel. The thing failed this\r\n",
      "time, however, so the boys shouldered their tools and went away feeling\r\n",
      "that they had not trifled with fortune, but had fulfilled all the\r\n",
      "requirements that belong to the business of treasure-hunting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and\r\n",
      "grisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun,\r\n",
      "and something so depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the\r\n",
      "place, that they were afraid, for a moment, to venture in. Then they\r\n",
      "crept to the door and took a trembling peep. They saw a weedgrown,\r\n",
      "floorless room, unplastered, an ancient fireplace, vacant windows,\r\n",
      "a ruinous staircase; and here, there, and everywhere hung ragged and\r\n",
      "abandoned cobwebs. They presently entered, softly, with quickened\r\n",
      "pulses, talking in whispers, ears alert to catch the slightest sound,\r\n",
      "and muscles tense and ready for instant retreat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the\r\n",
      "place a critical and interested examination, rather admiring their own\r\n",
      "boldness, and wondering at it, too. Next they wanted to look upstairs.\r\n",
      "This was something like cutting off retreat, but they got to daring\r\n",
      "each other, and of course there could be but one result—they threw their\r\n",
      "tools into a corner and made the ascent. Up there were the same signs of\r\n",
      "decay. In one corner they found a closet that promised mystery, but the\r\n",
      "promise was a fraud—there was nothing in it. Their courage was up now\r\n",
      "and well in hand. They were about to go down and begin work when—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Sh!” said Tom.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is it?” whispered Huck, blanching with fright.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Sh!... There!... Hear it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes!... Oh, my! Let’s run!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Keep still! Don’t you budge! They’re coming right toward the door.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to\r\n",
      "knotholes in the planking, and lay waiting, in a misery of fear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They’ve stopped.... No—coming.... Here they are. Don’t whisper another\r\n",
      "word, Huck. My goodness, I wish I was out of this!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Two men entered. Each boy said to himself: “There’s the old deaf and\r\n",
      "dumb Spaniard that’s been about town once or twice lately—never saw\r\n",
      "t’other man before.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“T’other” was a ragged, unkempt creature, with nothing very pleasant\r\n",
      "in his face. The Spaniard was wrapped in a serape; he had bushy white\r\n",
      "whiskers; long white hair flowed from under his sombrero, and he wore\r\n",
      "green goggles. When they came in, “t’other” was talking in a low voice;\r\n",
      "they sat down on the ground, facing the door, with their backs to the\r\n",
      "wall, and the speaker continued his remarks. His manner became less\r\n",
      "guarded and his words more distinct as he proceeded:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” said he, “I’ve thought it all over, and I don’t like it. It’s\r\n",
      "dangerous.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dangerous!” grunted the “deaf and dumb” Spaniard—to the vast surprise\r\n",
      "of the boys. “Milksop!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This voice made the boys gasp and quake. It was Injun Joe’s! There was\r\n",
      "silence for some time. Then Joe said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What’s any more dangerous than that job up yonder—but nothing’s come of\r\n",
      "it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s different. Away up the river so, and not another house about.\r\n",
      "’Twon’t ever be known that we tried, anyway, long as we didn’t succeed.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, what’s more dangerous than coming here in the daytime!—anybody\r\n",
      "would suspicion us that saw us.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I know that. But there warn’t any other place as handy after that fool\r\n",
      "of a job. I want to quit this shanty. I wanted to yesterday, only it\r\n",
      "warn’t any use trying to stir out of here, with those infernal boys\r\n",
      "playing over there on the hill right in full view.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Those infernal boys” quaked again under the inspiration of this remark,\r\n",
      "and thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it was Friday and\r\n",
      "concluded to wait a day. They wished in their hearts they had waited a\r\n",
      "year.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The two men got out some food and made a luncheon. After a long and\r\n",
      "thoughtful silence, Injun Joe said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Look here, lad—you go back up the river where you belong. Wait there\r\n",
      "till you hear from me. I’ll take the chances on dropping into this town\r\n",
      "just once more, for a look. We’ll do that ‘dangerous’ job after I’ve\r\n",
      "spied around a little and think things look well for it. Then for Texas!\r\n",
      "We’ll leg it together!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was satisfactory. Both men presently fell to yawning, and Injun Joe\r\n",
      "said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’m dead for sleep! It’s your turn to watch.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore. His comrade stirred\r\n",
      "him once or twice and he became quiet. Presently the watcher began to\r\n",
      "nod; his head drooped lower and lower, both men began to snore now.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The boys drew a long, grateful breath. Tom whispered:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now’s our chance—come!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Huck said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I can’t—I’d die if they was to wake.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom urged—Huck held back. At last Tom rose slowly and softly, and\r\n",
      "started alone. But the first step he made wrung such a hideous creak\r\n",
      "from the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with fright. He never\r\n",
      "made a second attempt. The boys lay there counting the dragging moments\r\n",
      "till it seemed to them that time must be done and eternity growing gray;\r\n",
      "and then they were grateful to note that at last the sun was setting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now one snore ceased. Injun Joe sat up, stared around—smiled grimly upon\r\n",
      "his comrade, whose head was drooping upon his knees—stirred him up with\r\n",
      "his foot and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Here! _You’re_ a watchman, ain’t you! All right, though—nothing’s\r\n",
      "happened.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My! have I been asleep?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, partly, partly. Nearly time for us to be moving, pard. What’ll we\r\n",
      "do with what little swag we’ve got left?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t know—leave it here as we’ve always done, I reckon. No use to\r\n",
      "take it away till we start south. Six hundred and fifty in silver’s\r\n",
      "something to carry.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well—all right—it won’t matter to come here once more.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No—but I’d say come in the night as we used to do—it’s better.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes: but look here; it may be a good while before I get the right\r\n",
      "chance at that job; accidents might happen; ’tain’t in such a very good\r\n",
      "place; we’ll just regularly bury it—and bury it deep.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good idea,” said the comrade, who walked across the room, knelt down,\r\n",
      "raised one of the rearward hearth-stones and took out a bag that jingled\r\n",
      "pleasantly. He subtracted from it twenty or thirty dollars for himself\r\n",
      "and as much for Injun Joe, and passed the bag to the latter, who was on\r\n",
      "his knees in the corner, now, digging with his bowie-knife.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The boys forgot all their fears, all their miseries in an instant. With\r\n",
      "gloating eyes they watched every movement. Luck!—the splendor of it was\r\n",
      "beyond all imagination! Six hundred dollars was money enough to make\r\n",
      "half a dozen boys rich! Here was treasure-hunting under the happiest\r\n",
      "auspices—there would not be any bothersome uncertainty as to where to\r\n",
      "dig. They nudged each other every moment—eloquent nudges and easily\r\n",
      "understood, for they simply meant—“Oh, but ain’t you glad _now_ we’re\r\n",
      "here!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Joe’s knife struck upon something.\r\n",

      "not very large; it was iron bound and had been very strong before the\r\n",

      "into trouble, who objects? It will be dark in fifteen minutes—and then\r\n",

      "they had happened in another world, or in a time long gone by. Then it\r\n",
      "occurred to him that the great adventure itself must be a dream! There\r\n",
      "was one very strong argument in favor of this idea—namely, that the\r\n",
      "quantity of coin he had seen was too vast to be real. He had never seen\r\n",
      "as much as fifty dollars in one mass before, and he was like all boys of\r\n",
      "his age and station in life, in that he imagined that all references to\r\n",
      "“hundreds” and “thousands” were mere fanciful forms of speech, and that\r\n",

      "excitement. In his uneasiness Huck found himself drawing closer\r\n",
      "and closer to the alley; fearing all sorts of dreadful things, and\r\n",
      "momentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take away\r\n",
      "his breath. There was not much to take away, for he seemed only able to\r\n",

      "THE first thing Tom heard on Friday morning was a glad piece of\r\n",
      "news—Judge Thatcher’s family had come back to town the night before.\r\n",
      "Both Injun Joe and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a\r\n",
      "moment, and Becky took the chief place in the boy’s interest. He saw her\r\n",
      "and they had an exhausting good time playing “hispy” and “gully-keeper”\r\n",
      " with a crowd of their schoolmates. The day was completed and crowned in\r\n",
      "a peculiarly satisfactory way: Becky teased her mother to appoint\r\n",
      "the next day for the long-promised and long-delayed picnic, and she\r\n",
      "consented. The child’s delight was boundless; and Tom’s not more\r\n",
      "moderate. The invitations were sent out before sunset, and straightway\r\n",
      "the young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation\r\n",
      "and pleasurable anticipation. Tom’s excitement enabled him to keep\r\n",
      "awake until a pretty late hour, and he had good hopes of hearing Huck’s\r\n",
      "“maow,” and of having his treasure to astonish Becky and the picnickers\r\n",
      "with, next day; but he was disappointed. No signal came that night.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Morning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven o’clock a giddy and\r\n",
      "rollicking company were gathered at Judge Thatcher’s, and everything was\r\n",
      "ready for a start. It was not the custom for elderly people to mar the\r\n",
      "picnics with their presence. The children were considered safe enough\r\n",
      "under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young\r\n",
      "gentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts. The old steam ferry-boat was\r\n",
      "chartered for the occasion; presently the gay throng filed up the main\r\n",
      "street laden with provision-baskets. Sid was sick and had to miss\r\n",
      "the fun; Mary remained at home to entertain him. The last thing Mrs.\r\n",
      "Thatcher said to Becky, was:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You’ll not get back till late. Perhaps you’d better stay all night with\r\n",
      "some of the girls that live near the ferry-landing, child.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then I’ll stay with Susy Harper, mamma.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Say—I’ll tell you what we’ll do. ’Stead of going to Joe Harper’s we’ll\r\n",
      "climb right up the hill and stop at the Widow Douglas’. She’ll have\r\n",
      "ice-cream! She has it most every day—dead loads of it. And she’ll be\r\n",
      "awful glad to have us.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, that will be fun!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Becky reflected a moment and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But what will mamma say?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How’ll she ever know?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I reckon it’s wrong—but—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But shucks! Your mother won’t know, and so what’s the harm? All she\r\n",
      "wants is that you’ll be safe; and I bet you she’d ’a’ said go there if\r\n",
      "she’d ’a’ thought of it. I know she would!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Widow Douglas’ splendid hospitality was a tempting bait. It and\r\n",
      "Tom’s persuasions presently carried the day. So it was decided to say\r\n",
      "nothing to anybody about the night’s programme. Presently it occurred to\r\n",
      "Tom that maybe Huck might come this very night and give the signal. The\r\n",
      "thought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations. Still he\r\n",
      "could not bear to give up the fun at Widow Douglas’. And why should he\r\n",
      "give it up, he reasoned—the signal did not come the night before, so\r\n",
      "why should it be any more likely to come tonight? The sure fun of the\r\n",
      "evening outweighed the uncertain treasure; and, boy-like, he determined\r\n",
      "to yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of\r\n",
      "the box of money another time that day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Three miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody\r\n",
      "hollow and tied up. The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest\r\n",
      "distances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and\r\n",
      "laughter. All the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone\r\n",
      "through with, and by-and-by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified\r\n",
      "with responsible appetites, and then the destruction of the good things\r\n",
      "began. After the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat in\r\n",
      "the shade of spreading oaks. By-and-by somebody shouted:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who’s ready for the cave?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Everybody was. Bundles of candles were procured, and straightway there\r\n",
      "was a general scamper up the hill. The mouth of the cave was up the\r\n",
      "hillside—an opening shaped like a letter A. Its massive oaken door stood\r\n",
      "unbarred. Within was a small chamber, chilly as an icehouse, and walled\r\n",
      "by Nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat. It was\r\n",
      "romantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out\r\n",
      "upon the green valley shining in the sun. But the impressiveness of the\r\n",
      "situation quickly wore off, and the romping began again. The moment\r\n",
      "a candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it; a\r\n",
      "struggle and a gallant defence followed, but the candle was soon knocked\r\n",
      "down or blown out, and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a\r\n",
      "new chase. But all things have an end. By-and-by the procession went\r\n",
      "filing down the steep descent of the main avenue, the flickering rank of\r\n",
      "lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of\r\n",
      "junction sixty feet overhead. This main avenue was not more than\r\n",
      "eight or ten feet wide. Every few steps other lofty and still narrower\r\n",
      "crevices branched from it on either hand—for McDougal’s cave was but a\r\n",
      "vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and out again\r\n",
      "and led nowhere. It was said that one might wander days and nights\r\n",
      "together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms, and never\r\n",
      "find the end of the cave; and that he might go down, and down, and\r\n",
      "still down, into the earth, and it was just the same—labyrinth under\r\n",
      "labyrinth, and no end to any of them. No man “knew” the cave. That was\r\n",
      "an impossible thing. Most of the young men knew a portion of it, and it\r\n",
      "was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion. Tom Sawyer\r\n",
      "knew as much of the cave as any one.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The procession moved along the main avenue some three-quarters of\r\n",
      "a mile, and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch\r\n",
      "avenues, fly along the dismal corridors, and take each other by surprise\r\n",
      "at points where the corridors joined again. Parties were able to elude\r\n",
      "each other for the space of half an hour without going beyond the\r\n",
      "“known” ground.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By-and-by, one group after another came straggling back to the mouth\r\n",
      "of the cave, panting, hilarious, smeared from head to foot with tallow\r\n",
      "drippings, daubed with clay, and entirely delighted with the success of\r\n",
      "the day. Then they were astonished to find that they had been taking\r\n",
      "no note of time and that night was about at hand. The clanging bell had\r\n",
      "been calling for half an hour. However, this sort of close to the day’s\r\n",
      "adventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory. When the ferryboat\r\n",
      "with her wild freight pushed into the stream, nobody cared sixpence for\r\n",
      "the wasted time but the captain of the craft.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Huck was already upon his watch when the ferryboat’s lights went\r\n",
      "glinting past the wharf. He heard no noise on board, for the young\r\n",
      "people were as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearly\r\n",
      "tired to death. He wondered what boat it was, and why she did not\r\n",
      "stop at the wharf—and then he dropped her out of his mind and put his\r\n",
      "attention upon his business. The night was growing cloudy and dark. Ten\r\n",
      "o’clock came, and the noise of vehicles ceased, scattered lights began\r\n",
      "to wink out, all straggling foot-passengers disappeared, the village\r\n",
      "betook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the\r\n",
      "silence and the ghosts. Eleven o’clock came, and the tavern lights were\r\n",
      "put out; darkness everywhere, now. Huck waited what seemed a weary long\r\n",
      "time, but nothing happened. His faith was weakening. Was there any use?\r\n",
      "Was there really any use? Why not give it up and turn in?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A noise fell upon his ear. He was all attention in an instant. The alley\r\n",
      "door closed softly. He sprang to the corner of the brick store. The next\r\n",
      "moment two men brushed by him, and one seemed to have something under\r\n",
      "his arm. It must be that box! So they were going to remove the treasure.\r\n",
      "Why call Tom now? It would be absurd—the men would get away with the box\r\n",
      "and never be found again. No, he would stick to their wake and follow\r\n",
      "them; he would trust to the darkness for security from discovery. So\r\n",
      "communing with himself, Huck stepped out and glided along behind the\r\n",
      "men, cat-like, with bare feet, allowing them to keep just far enough\r\n",
      "ahead not to be invisible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They moved up the river street three blocks, then turned to the left up\r\n",
      "a crossstreet. They went straight ahead, then, until they came to the\r\n",
      "path that led up Cardiff Hill; this they took. They passed by the old\r\n",
      "Welshman’s house, halfway up the hill, without hesitating, and still\r\n",
      "climbed upward. Good, thought Huck, they will bury it in the old quarry.\r\n",
      "But they never stopped at the quarry. They passed on, up the summit.\r\n",
      "They plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumach bushes, and\r\n",
      "were at once hidden in the gloom. Huck closed up and shortened his\r\n",
      "distance, now, for they would never be able to see him. He trotted along\r\n",
      "awhile; then slackened his pace, fearing he was gaining too fast; moved\r\n",
      "on a piece, then stopped altogether; listened; no sound; none, save that\r\n",
      "he seemed to hear the beating of his own heart. The hooting of an\r\n",
      "owl came over the hill—ominous sound! But no footsteps. Heavens, was\r\n",
      "everything lost! He was about to spring with winged feet, when a man\r\n",
      "cleared his throat not four feet from him! Huck’s heart shot into his\r\n",
      "throat, but he swallowed it again; and then he stood there shaking as\r\n",
      "if a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once, and so weak that he\r\n",
      "thought he must surely fall to the ground. He knew where he was. He\r\n",
      "knew he was within five steps of the stile leading into Widow Douglas’\r\n",
      "grounds. Very well, he thought, let them bury it there; it won’t be hard\r\n",
      "to find.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now there was a voice—a very low voice—Injun Joe’s:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Damn her, maybe she’s got company—there’s lights, late as it is.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I can’t see any.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was that stranger’s voice—the stranger of the haunted house. A\r\n",
      "deadly chill went to Huck’s heart—this, then, was the “revenge” job! His\r\n",
      "thought was, to fly. Then he remembered that the Widow Douglas had been\r\n",
      "kind to him more than once, and maybe these men were going to murder\r\n",
      "her. He wished he dared venture to warn her; but he knew he didn’t\r\n",
      "dare—they might come and catch him. He thought all this and more in\r\n",
      "the moment that elapsed between the stranger’s remark and Injun Joe’s\r\n",
      "next—which was—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Because the bush is in your way. Now—this way—now you see, don’t you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes. Well, there _is_ company there, I reckon. Better give it up.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Give it up, and I just leaving this country forever! Give it up and\r\n",
      "maybe never have another chance. I tell you again, as I’ve told you\r\n",
      "before, I don’t care for her swag—you may have it. But her husband was\r\n",
      "rough on me—many times he was rough on me—and mainly he was the justice\r\n",
      "of the peace that jugged me for a vagrant. And that ain’t all. It ain’t\r\n",
      "a millionth part of it! He had me _horsewhipped_!—horsewhipped in\r\n",
      "front of the jail, like a !—with all the town looking on!\r\n",
      "_Horsewhipped_!—do you understand? He took advantage of me and died. But\r\n",
      "I’ll take it out of _her_.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, don’t kill her! Don’t do that!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Kill? Who said anything about killing? I would kill _him_ if he was\r\n",
      "here; but not her. When you want to get revenge on a woman you don’t\r\n",
      "kill her—bosh! you go for her looks. You slit her nostrils—you notch her\r\n",
      "ears like a sow!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“By God, that’s—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Keep your opinion to yourself! It will be safest for you. I’ll tie her\r\n",
      "to the bed. If she bleeds to death, is that my fault? I’ll not cry, if\r\n",
      "she does. My friend, you’ll help me in this thing—for _my_ sake—that’s\r\n",
      "why you’re here—I mightn’t be able alone. If you flinch, I’ll kill you.\r\n",
      "Do you understand that? And if I have to kill you, I’ll kill her—and\r\n",
      "then I reckon nobody’ll ever know much about who done this business.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, if it’s got to be done, let’s get at it. The quicker the\r\n",
      "better—I’m all in a shiver.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do it _now_? And company there? Look here—I’ll get suspicious of you,\r\n",
      "first thing you know. No—we’ll wait till the lights are out—there’s no\r\n",
      "hurry.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Huck felt that a silence was going to ensue—a thing still more awful\r\n",
      "than any amount of murderous talk; so he held his breath and stepped\r\n",
      "gingerly back; planted his foot carefully and firmly, after balancing,\r\n",
      "one-legged, in a precarious way and almost toppling over, first on one\r\n",
      "side and then on the other. He took another step back, with the same\r\n",
      "elaboration and the same risks; then another and another, and—a twig\r\n",
      "snapped under his foot! His breath stopped and he listened. There was no\r\n",
      "sound—the stillness was perfect. His gratitude was measureless. Now he\r\n",
      "turned in his tracks, between the walls of sumach bushes—turned\r\n",
      "himself as carefully as if he were a ship—and then stepped quickly but\r\n",
      "cautiously along. When he emerged at the quarry he felt secure, and\r\n",
      "so he picked up his nimble heels and flew. Down, down he sped, till he\r\n",
      "reached the Welshman’s. He banged at the door, and presently the heads\r\n",
      "of the old man and his two stalwart sons were thrust from windows.\r\n",

      "“What’s the row there? Who’s banging? What do you want?”\r\n",

      "to me sometimes, and I want to tell—I _will_ tell if you’ll promise you\r\n",
      "won’t ever say it was me.”\r\n",

      "their hands. Huck accompanied them no further. He hid behind a great\r\n",
      "bowlder and fell to listening. There was a lagging, anxious silence, and\r\n",
      "then all of a sudden there was an explosion of firearms and a cry.\r\n",

      "AS the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on Sunday morning, Huck came\r\n",
      "groping up the hill and rapped gently at the old Welshman’s door. The\r\n",
      "inmates were asleep, but it was a sleep that was set on a hair-trigger,\r\n",
      "on account of the exciting episode of the night. A call came from a\r\n",

      "he had ever heard. He could not recollect that the closing word had ever\r\n",
      "been applied in his case before. The door was quickly unlocked, and he\r\n",
      "entered. Huck was given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Now, my boy, I hope you’re good and hungry, because breakfast will be\r\n",

      "brought from the tavern was the treasure, as soon as he had heard the\r\n",
      "talk at the widow’s stile. He had only thought it was not the treasure,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Just as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door. Huck\r\n",
      "jumped for a hiding-place, for he had no mind to be connected even\r\n",
      "remotely with the late event. The Welshman admitted several ladies and\r\n",
      "gentlemen, among them the Widow Douglas, and noticed that groups of\r\n",
      "citizens were climbing up the hill—to stare at the stile. So the news\r\n",
      "had spread. The Welshman had to tell the story of the night to the\r\n",
      "visitors. The widow’s gratitude for her preservation was outspoken.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t say a word about it, madam. There’s another that you’re more\r\n",

      "far from the section usually traversed by tourists, the names “BECKY &\r\n",

      "were not frescoed. They smoked their own names under an overhanging\r\n",
      "shelf and moved on. Presently they came to a place where a little stream\r\n",
      "of water, trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone sediment with\r\n",
      "it, had, in the slow-dragging ages, formed a laced and ruffled Niagara\r\n",
      "in gleaming and imperishable stone. Tom squeezed his small body behind\r\n",
      "it in order to illuminate it for Becky’s gratification. He found that\r\n",
      "it curtained a sort of steep natural stairway which was enclosed between\r\n",
      "narrow walls, and at once the ambition to be a discoverer seized him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Becky responded to his call, and they made a smoke-mark for future\r\n",
      "guidance, and started upon their quest. They wound this way and that,\r\n",
      "far down into the secret depths of the cave, made another mark, and\r\n",
      "branched off in search of novelties to tell the upper world about. In\r\n",
      "one place they found a spacious cavern, from whose ceiling depended a\r\n",
      "multitude of shining stalactites of the length and circumference of\r\n",
      "a man’s leg; they walked all about it, wondering and admiring, and\r\n",
      "presently left it by one of the numerous passages that opened into\r\n",
      "it. This shortly brought them to a bewitching spring, whose basin was\r\n",
      "incrusted with a frostwork of glittering crystals; it was in the midst\r\n",
      "of a cavern whose walls were supported by many fantastic pillars which\r\n",
      "had been formed by the joining of great stalactites and stalagmites\r\n",
      "together, the result of the ceaseless water-drip of centuries. Under the\r\n",
      "roof vast knots of bats had packed themselves together, thousands in a\r\n",
      "bunch; the lights disturbed the creatures and they came flocking down by\r\n",
      "hundreds, squeaking and darting furiously at the candles. Tom knew their\r\n",
      "ways and the danger of this sort of conduct. He seized Becky’s hand and\r\n",
      "hurried her into the first corridor that offered; and none too soon, for\r\n",
      "a bat struck Becky’s light out with its wing while she was passing out\r\n",
      "of the cavern. The bats chased the children a good distance; but the\r\n",
      "fugitives plunged into every new passage that offered, and at last got\r\n",
      "rid of the perilous things. Tom found a subterranean lake, shortly,\r\n",
      "which stretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the\r\n",
      "shadows. He wanted to explore its borders, but concluded that it would\r\n",
      "be best to sit down and rest awhile, first. Now, for the first time, the\r\n",
      "deep stillness of the place laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the\r\n",
      "children. Becky said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, I didn’t notice, but it seems ever so long since I heard any of\r\n",
      "the others.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come to think, Becky, we are away down below them—and I don’t know how\r\n",
      "far away north, or south, or east, or whichever it is. We couldn’t hear\r\n",
      "them here.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Becky grew apprehensive.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I wonder how long we’ve been down here, Tom? We better start back.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I reckon we better. P’raps we better.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Can you find the way, Tom? It’s all a mixed-up crookedness to me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I reckon I could find it—but then the bats. If they put our candles\r\n",
      "out it will be an awful fix. Let’s try some other way, so as not to go\r\n",
      "through there.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well. But I hope we won’t get lost. It would be so awful!” and the girl\r\n",
      "shuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They started through a corridor, and traversed it in silence a long\r\n",
      "way, glancing at each new opening, to see if there was anything familiar\r\n",
      "about the look of it; but they were all strange. Every time Tom made an\r\n",
      "examination, Becky would watch his face for an encouraging sign, and he\r\n",
      "would say cheerily:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, it’s all right. This ain’t the one, but we’ll come to it right\r\n",
      "away!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But he felt less and less hopeful with each failure, and presently began\r\n",
      "to turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random, in desperate hope of\r\n",
      "finding the one that was wanted. He still said it was “all right,” but\r\n",
      "there was such a leaden dread at his heart that the words had lost their\r\n",
      "ring and sounded just as if he had said, “All is lost!” Becky clung to\r\n",
      "his side in an anguish of fear, and tried hard to keep back the tears,\r\n",
      "but they would come. At last she said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, Tom, never mind the bats, let’s go back that way! We seem to get\r\n",
      "worse and worse off all the time.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Listen!” said he.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Profound silence; silence so deep that even their breathings were\r\n",
      "conspicuous in the hush. Tom shouted. The call went echoing down\r\n",
      "the empty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound that\r\n",
      "resembled a ripple of mocking laughter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, don’t do it again, Tom, it is too horrid,” said Becky.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is horrid, but I better, Becky; they might hear us, you know,” and\r\n",
      "he shouted again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The “might” was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter, it so\r\n",
      "confessed a perishing hope. The children stood still and listened; but\r\n",
      "there was no result. Tom turned upon the back track at once, and hurried\r\n",
      "his steps. It was but a little while before a certain indecision in his\r\n",
      "manner revealed another fearful fact to Becky—he could not find his way\r\n",
      "back!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, Tom, you didn’t make any marks!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Becky, I was such a fool! Such a fool! I never thought we might want to\r\n",
      "come back! No—I can’t find the way. It’s all mixed up.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tom, Tom, we’re lost! we’re lost! We never can get out of this awful\r\n",
      "place! Oh, why _did_ we ever leave the others!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that Tom\r\n",
      "was appalled with the idea that she might die, or lose her reason. He\r\n",
      "sat down by her and put his arms around her; she buried her face in\r\n",
      "his bosom, she clung to him, she poured out her terrors, her unavailing\r\n",
      "regrets, and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter. Tom\r\n",
      "begged her to pluck up hope again, and she said she could not. He fell\r\n",
      "to blaming and abusing himself for getting her into this miserable\r\n",
      "situation; this had a better effect. She said she would try to hope\r\n",
      "again, she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he\r\n",
      "would not talk like that any more. For he was no more to blame than she,\r\n",
      "she said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So they moved on again—aimlessly—simply at random—all they could do\r\n",
      "was to move, keep moving. For a little while, hope made a show of\r\n",
      "reviving—not with any reason to back it, but only because it is its\r\n",
      "nature to revive when the spring has not been taken out of it by age and\r\n",
      "familiarity with failure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By-and-by Tom took Becky’s candle and blew it out. This economy meant so\r\n",
      "much! Words were not needed. Becky understood, and her hope died again.\r\n",
      "She knew that Tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in his\r\n",
      "pockets—yet he must economize.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By-and-by, fatigue began to assert its claims; the children tried to pay\r\n",
      "attention, for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was\r\n",
      "grown to be so precious, moving, in some direction, in any direction,\r\n",
      "was at least progress and might bear fruit; but to sit down was to\r\n",
      "invite death and shorten its pursuit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last Becky’s frail limbs refused to carry her farther. She sat down.\r\n",
      "Tom rested with her, and they talked of home, and the friends there,\r\n",
      "and the comfortable beds and, above all, the light! Becky cried, and Tom\r\n",
      "tried to think of some way of comforting her, but all his encouragements\r\n",
      "were grown thread-bare with use, and sounded like sarcasms. Fatigue bore\r\n",
      "so heavily upon Becky that she drowsed off to sleep. Tom was grateful.\r\n",
      "He sat looking into her drawn face and saw it grow smooth and natural\r\n",
      "under the influence of pleasant dreams; and by-and-by a smile dawned and\r\n",
      "rested there. The peaceful face reflected somewhat of peace and healing\r\n",
      "into his own spirit, and his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and\r\n",
      "dreamy memories. While he was deep in his musings, Becky woke up with a\r\n",
      "breezy little laugh—but it was stricken dead upon her lips, and a groan\r\n",
      "followed it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, how _could_ I sleep! I wish I never, never had waked! No! No, I\r\n",
      "don’t, Tom! Don’t look so! I won’t say it again.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’m glad you’ve slept, Becky; you’ll feel rested, now, and we’ll find\r\n",
      "the way out.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We can try, Tom; but I’ve seen such a beautiful country in my dream. I\r\n",
      "reckon we are going there.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Maybe not, maybe not. Cheer up, Becky, and let’s go on trying.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They rose up and wandered along, hand in hand and hopeless. They tried\r\n",
      "to estimate how long they had been in the cave, but all they knew was\r\n",
      "that it seemed days and weeks, and yet it was plain that this could not\r\n",
      "be, for their candles were not gone yet. A long time after this—they\r\n",
      "could not tell how long—Tom said they must go softly and listen for\r\n",
      "dripping water—they must find a spring. They found one presently, and\r\n",
      "Tom said it was time to rest again. Both were cruelly tired, yet Becky\r\n",
      "said she thought she could go a little farther. She was surprised to\r\n",
      "hear Tom dissent. She could not understand it. They sat down, and Tom\r\n",
      "fastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay. Thought\r\n",
      "was soon busy; nothing was said for some time. Then Becky broke the\r\n",
      "silence:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tom, I am so hungry!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom took something out of his pocket.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you remember this?” said he.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Becky almost smiled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s our wedding-cake, Tom.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes—I wish it was as big as a barrel, for it’s all we’ve got.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I saved it from the picnic for us to dream on, Tom, the way grownup\r\n",
      "people do with wedding-cake—but it’ll be our—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She dropped the sentence where it was. Tom divided the cake and Becky\r\n",
      "ate with good appetite, while Tom nibbled at his moiety. There was\r\n",
      "abundance of cold water to finish the feast with. By-and-by Becky\r\n",
      "suggested that they move on again. Tom was silent a moment. Then he\r\n",
      "said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Becky, can you bear it if I tell you something?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Becky’s face paled, but she thought she could.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, then, Becky, we must stay here, where there’s water to drink.\r\n",
      "That little piece is our last candle!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Becky gave loose to tears and wailings. Tom did what he could to comfort\r\n",
      "her, but with little effect. At length Becky said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tom!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, Becky?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They’ll miss us and hunt for us!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, they will! Certainly they will!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Maybe they’re hunting for us now, Tom.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, I reckon maybe they are. I hope they are.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“When would they miss us, Tom?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“When they get back to the boat, I reckon.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tom, it might be dark then—would they notice we hadn’t come?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t know. But anyway, your mother would miss you as soon as they\r\n",
      "got home.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A frightened look in Becky’s face brought Tom to his senses and he saw\r\n",
      "that he had made a blunder. Becky was not to have gone home that night!\r\n",
      "The children became silent and thoughtful. In a moment a new burst of\r\n",
      "grief from Becky showed Tom that the thing in his mind had struck hers\r\n",
      "also—that the Sabbath morning might be half spent before Mrs. Thatcher\r\n",
      "discovered that Becky was not at Mrs. Harper’s.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and watched it\r\n",
      "melt slowly and pitilessly away; saw the half inch of wick stand alone\r\n",
      "at last; saw the feeble flame rise and fall, climb the thin column of\r\n",
      "smoke, linger at its top a moment, and then—the horror of utter darkness\r\n",
      "reigned!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How long afterward it was that Becky came to a slow consciousness that\r\n",
      "she was crying in Tom’s arms, neither could tell. All that they knew\r\n",
      "was, that after what seemed a mighty stretch of time, both awoke out of\r\n",
      "a dead stupor of sleep and resumed their miseries once more. Tom said\r\n",
      "it might be Sunday, now—maybe Monday. He tried to get Becky to talk, but\r\n",
      "her sorrows were too oppressive, all her hopes were gone. Tom said that\r\n",
      "they must have been missed long ago, and no doubt the search was going\r\n",
      "on. He would shout and maybe some one would come. He tried it; but in\r\n",
      "the darkness the distant echoes sounded so hideously that he tried it no\r\n",
      "more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The hours wasted away, and hunger came to torment the captives again. A\r\n",
      "portion of Tom’s half of the cake was left; they divided and ate it. But\r\n",
      "they seemed hungrier than before. The poor morsel of food only whetted\r\n",
      "desire.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By-and-by Tom said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“SH! Did you hear that?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Both held their breath and listened. There was a sound like the\r\n",
      "faintest, far-off shout. Instantly Tom answered it, and leading Becky by\r\n",
      "the hand, started groping down the corridor in its direction. Presently\r\n",
      "he listened again; again the sound was heard, and apparently a little\r\n",
      "nearer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s them!” said Tom; “they’re coming! Come along, Becky—we’re all\r\n",
      "right now!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming. Their speed was slow,\r\n",
      "however, because pitfalls were somewhat common, and had to be guarded\r\n",
      "against. They shortly came to one and had to stop. It might be three\r\n",
      "feet deep, it might be a hundred—there was no passing it at any rate.\r\n",
      "Tom got down on his breast and reached as far down as he could. No\r\n",
      "bottom. They must stay there and wait until the searchers came. They\r\n",
      "listened; evidently the distant shoutings were growing more distant!\r\n",
      "a moment or two more and they had gone altogether. The heart-sinking\r\n",
      "misery of it! Tom whooped until he was hoarse, but it was of no use. He\r\n",
      "talked hopefully to Becky; but an age of anxious waiting passed and no\r\n",
      "sounds came again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The children groped their way back to the spring. The weary time dragged\r\n",
      "on; they slept again, and awoke famished and woe-stricken. Tom believed\r\n",
      "it must be Tuesday by this time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now an idea struck him. There were some side passages near at hand. It\r\n",
      "would be better to explore some of these than bear the weight of the\r\n",
      "heavy time in idleness. He took a kite-line from his pocket, tied it to\r\n",
      "a projection, and he and Becky started, Tom in the lead, unwinding the\r\n",
      "line as he groped along. At the end of twenty steps the corridor ended\r\n",
      "in a “jumping-off place.” Tom got down on his knees and felt below,\r\n",
      "and then as far around the corner as he could reach with his hands\r\n",
      "conveniently; he made an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the\r\n",
      "right, and at that moment, not twenty yards away, a human hand, holding\r\n",
      "a candle, appeared from behind a rock! Tom lifted up a glorious shout,\r\n",
      "and instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged to—Injun\r\n",
      "Joe’s! Tom was paralyzed; he could not move. He was vastly gratified the\r\n",
      "next moment, to see the “Spaniard” take to his heels and get himself out\r\n",
      "of sight. Tom wondered that Joe had not recognized his voice and come\r\n",
      "over and killed him for testifying in court. But the echoes must have\r\n",
      "disguised the voice. Without doubt, that was it, he reasoned. Tom’s\r\n",
      "fright weakened every muscle in his body. He said to himself that if he\r\n",
      "had strength enough to get back to the spring he would stay there, and\r\n",
      "nothing should tempt him to run the risk of meeting Injun Joe again. He\r\n",
      "was careful to keep from Becky what it was he had seen. He told her he\r\n",
      "had only shouted “for luck.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long run.\r\n",
      "Another tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep brought\r\n",
      "changes. The children awoke tortured with a raging hunger. Tom believed\r\n",
      "that it must be Wednesday or Thursday or even Friday or Saturday, now,\r\n",
      "and that the search had been given over. He proposed to explore another\r\n",
      "passage. He felt willing to risk Injun Joe and all other terrors. But\r\n",
      "Becky was very weak. She had sunk into a dreary apathy and would not be\r\n",
      "roused. She said she would wait, now, where she was, and die—it would\r\n",
      "not be long. She told Tom to go with the kite-line and explore if he\r\n",
      "chose; but she implored him to come back every little while and speak\r\n",
      "to her; and she made him promise that when the awful time came, he would\r\n",
      "stay by her and hold her hand until all was over.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom kissed her, with a choking sensation in his throat, and made a show\r\n",
      "of being confident of finding the searchers or an escape from the cave;\r\n",
      "then he took the kite-line in his hand and went groping down one of the\r\n",
      "passages on his hands and knees, distressed with hunger and sick with\r\n",
      "bodings of coming doom.\r\n",

      "TUESDAY afternoon came, and waned to the twilight. The village of St.\r\n",
      "Petersburg still mourned. The lost children had not been found. Public\r\n",
      "prayers had been offered up for them, and many and many a private prayer\r\n",
      "that had the petitioner’s whole heart in it; but still no good news came\r\n",

      "then lay it wearily down again with a moan. Aunt Polly had drooped into\r\n",

      "village went to its rest on Tuesday night, sad and forlorn.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Away in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village\r\n",
      "bells, and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half-clad\r\n",
      "people, who shouted, “Turn out! turn out! they’re found! they’re found!”\r\n",
      " Tin pans and horns were added to the din, the population massed itself\r\n",
      "and moved toward the river, met the children coming in an open carriage\r\n",
      "drawn by shouting citizens, thronged around it, joined its homeward\r\n",
      "march, and swept magnificently up the main street roaring huzzah after\r\n",
      "huzzah!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The village was illuminated; nobody went to bed again; it was the\r\n",
      "greatest night the little town had ever seen. During the first half-hour\r\n",
      "a procession of villagers filed through Judge Thatcher’s house, seized\r\n",
      "the saved ones and kissed them, squeezed Mrs. Thatcher’s hand, tried to\r\n",
      "speak but couldn’t—and drifted out raining tears all over the place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Aunt Polly’s happiness was complete, and Mrs. Thatcher’s nearly so. It\r\n",
      "would be complete, however, as soon as the messenger dispatched with the\r\n",
      "great news to the cave should get the word to her husband. Tom lay upon\r\n",
      "a sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of the\r\n",
      "wonderful adventure, putting in many striking additions to adorn it\r\n",
      "withal; and closed with a description of how he left Becky and went\r\n",
      "on an exploring expedition; how he followed two avenues as far as his\r\n",
      "kite-line would reach; how he followed a third to the fullest stretch\r\n",
      "of the kite-line, and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far-off\r\n",
      "speck that looked like daylight; dropped the line and groped toward it,\r\n",
      "pushed his head and shoulders through a small hole, and saw the broad\r\n",
      "Mississippi rolling by!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And if it had only happened to be night he would not have seen that\r\n",
      "speck of daylight and would not have explored that passage any more! He\r\n",
      "told how he went back for Becky and broke the good news and she told\r\n",
      "him not to fret her with such stuff, for she was tired, and knew she was\r\n",
      "going to die, and wanted to. He described how he labored with her and\r\n",
      "convinced her; and how she almost died for joy when she had groped to\r\n",
      "where she actually saw the blue speck of daylight; how he pushed his way\r\n",
      "out at the hole and then helped her out; how they sat there and cried\r\n",
      "for gladness; how some men came along in a skiff and Tom hailed them\r\n",
      "and told them their situation and their famished condition; how the men\r\n",
      "didn’t believe the wild tale at first, “because,” said they, “you are\r\n",
      "five miles down the river below the valley the cave is in”—then took\r\n",
      "them aboard, rowed to a house, gave them supper, made them rest till two\r\n",
      "or three hours after dark and then brought them home.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Before day-dawn, Judge Thatcher and the handful of searchers with him\r\n",
      "were tracked out, in the cave, by the twine clews they had strung behind\r\n",
      "them, and informed of the great news.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Three days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to\r\n",
      "be shaken off at once, as Tom and Becky soon discovered. They were\r\n",
      "bedridden all of Wednesday and Thursday, and seemed to grow more and\r\n",
      "more tired and worn, all the time. Tom got about, a little, on Thursday,\r\n",
      "was downtown Friday, and nearly as whole as ever Saturday; but Becky\r\n",
      "did not leave her room until Sunday, and then she looked as if she had\r\n",
      "passed through a wasting illness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom learned of Huck’s sickness and went to see him on Friday, but could\r\n",
      "not be admitted to the bedroom; neither could he on Saturday or Sunday.\r\n",
      "He was admitted daily after that, but was warned to keep still about his\r\n",
      "adventure and introduce no exciting topic. The Widow Douglas stayed by\r\n",
      "to see that he obeyed. At home Tom learned of the Cardiff Hill event;\r\n",
      "also that the “ragged man’s” body had eventually been found in the river\r\n",
      "near the ferry-landing; he had been drowned while trying to escape,\r\n",
      "perhaps.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "About a fortnight after Tom’s rescue from the cave, he started off to\r\n",
      "visit Huck, who had grown plenty strong enough, now, to hear exciting\r\n",
      "talk, and Tom had some that would interest him, he thought. Judge\r\n",
      "Thatcher’s house was on Tom’s way, and he stopped to see Becky. The\r\n",
      "Judge and some friends set Tom to talking, and some one asked him\r\n",
      "ironically if he wouldn’t like to go to the cave again. Tom said he\r\n",
      "thought he wouldn’t mind it. The Judge said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, there are others just like you, Tom, I’ve not the least doubt.\r\n",
      "But we have taken care of that. Nobody will get lost in that cave any\r\n",
      "more.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Because I had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago, and\r\n",
      "triple-locked—and I’ve got the keys.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tom turned as white as a sheet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What’s the matter, boy! Here, run, somebody! Fetch a glass of water!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The water was brought and thrown into Tom’s face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, now you’re all right. What was the matter with you, Tom?”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "WITHIN a few minutes the news had spread, and a dozen skiff-loads of\r\n",
      "men were on their way to McDougal’s cave, and the ferryboat, well filled\r\n",
      "with passengers, soon followed. Tom Sawyer was in the skiff that bore\r\n",
      "Judge Thatcher.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the cave door was unlocked, a sorrowful sight presented itself in\r\n",
      "the dim twilight of the place. Injun Joe lay stretched upon the ground,\r\n",
      "dead, with his face close to the crack of the door, as if his longing\r\n",
      "eyes had been fixed, to the latest moment, upon the light and the cheer\r\n",
      "of the free world outside. Tom was touched, for he knew by his own\r\n",
      "experience how this wretch had suffered. His pity was moved, but\r\n",
      "nevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security, now,\r\n",
      "which revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated\r\n",
      "before how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day\r\n",
      "he lifted his voice against this bloody-minded outcast.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Injun Joe’s bowie-knife lay close by, its blade broken in two. The great\r\n",
      "foundation-beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through, with\r\n",
      "tedious labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the native rock formed a\r\n",
      "sill outside it, and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought\r\n",
      "no effect; the only damage done was to the knife itself. But if there\r\n",
      "had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been useless\r\n",
      "still, for if the beam had been wholly cut away Injun Joe could not have\r\n",
      "squeezed his body under the door, and he knew it. So he had only hacked\r\n",
      "that place in order to be doing something—in order to pass the weary\r\n",
      "time—in order to employ his tortured faculties. Ordinarily one could\r\n",
      "find half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices of this\r\n",
      "vestibule, left there by tourists; but there were none now. The prisoner\r\n",
      "had searched them out and eaten them. He had also contrived to catch a\r\n",
      "few bats, and these, also, he had eaten, leaving only their claws. The\r\n",
      "poor unfortunate had starved to death. In one place, near at hand, a\r\n",
      "stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages, builded\r\n",
      "by the water-drip from a stalactite overhead. The captive had broken off\r\n",
      "the stalagmite, and upon the stump had placed a stone, wherein he had\r\n",
      "scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop that fell once\r\n",
      "in every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a clock-tick—a\r\n",
      "dessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours. That drop was falling\r\n",
      "when the Pyramids were new; when Troy fell; when the foundations of Rome\r\n",
      "were laid; when Christ was crucified; when the Conqueror created the\r\n",
      "British empire; when Columbus sailed; when the massacre at Lexington was\r\n",
      "“news.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is falling now; it will still be falling when all these things shall\r\n",
      "have sunk down the afternoon of history, and the twilight of tradition,\r\n",
      "and been swallowed up in the thick night of oblivion. Has everything a\r\n",
      "purpose and a mission? Did this drop fall patiently during five thousand\r\n",
      "years to be ready for this flitting human insect’s need? and has it\r\n",
      "another important object to accomplish ten thousand years to come? No\r\n",
      "matter. It is many and many a year since the hapless half-breed scooped\r\n",
      "out the stone to catch the priceless drops, but to this day the tourist\r\n",
      "stares longest at that pathetic stone and that slow-dropping water when\r\n",
      "he comes to see the wonders of McDougal’s cave. Injun Joe’s cup stands\r\n",
      "first in the list of the cavern’s marvels; even “Aladdin’s Palace”\r\n",
      " cannot rival it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Injun Joe was buried near the mouth of the cave; and people flocked\r\n",
      "there in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms and\r\n",
      "hamlets for seven miles around; they brought their children, and\r\n",
      "all sorts of provisions, and confessed that they had had almost as\r\n",
      "satisfactory a time at the funeral as they could have had at the\r\n",
      "hanging.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This funeral stopped the further growth of one thing—the petition to the\r\n",
      "governor for Injun Joe’s pardon. The petition had been largely signed;\r\n",
      "many tearful and eloquent meetings had been held, and a committee of\r\n",
      "sappy women been appointed to go in deep mourning and wail around the\r\n",
      "governor, and implore him to be a merciful ass and trample his duty\r\n",
      "under foot. Injun Joe was believed to have killed five citizens of the\r\n",
      "village, but what of that? If he had been Satan himself there would\r\n",
      "have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a\r\n",
      "pardon-petition, and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired\r\n",
      "and leaky water-works.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The morning after the funeral Tom took Huck to a private place to have\r\n",
      "an important talk. Huck had learned all about Tom’s adventure from the\r\n",
      "Welshman and the Widow Douglas, by this time, but Tom said he reckoned\r\n",
      "there was one thing they had not told him; that thing was what he wanted\r\n",
      "to talk about now. Huck’s face saddened. He said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I know what it is. You got into No. 2 and never found anything but\r\n",
      "whiskey. Nobody told me it was you; but I just knowed it must ’a’ ben\r\n",
      "you, soon as I heard ’bout that whiskey business; and I knowed you\r\n",
      "hadn’t got the money becuz you’d ’a’ got at me some way or other and\r\n",
      "told me even if you was mum to everybody else. Tom, something’s always\r\n",
      "told me we’d never get holt of that swag.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, Huck, I never told on that tavern-keeper. _You_ know his tavern\r\n",
      "was all right the Saturday I went to the picnic. Don’t you remember you\r\n",
      "was to watch there that night?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh yes! Why, it seems ’bout a year ago. It was that very night that I\r\n",
      "follered Injun Joe to the widder’s.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“_You_ followed him?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes—but you keep mum. I reckon Injun Joe’s left friends behind him, and\r\n",
      "I don’t want ’em souring on me and doing me mean tricks. If it hadn’t\r\n",
      "ben for me he’d be down in Texas now, all right.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Huck told his entire adventure in confidence to Tom, who had only\r\n",
      "heard of the Welshman’s part of it before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well,” said Huck, presently, coming back to the main question, “whoever\r\n",
      "nipped the whiskey in No. 2, nipped the money, too, I reckon—anyways\r\n",
      "it’s a goner for us, Tom.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Huck, that money wasn’t ever in No. 2!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What!” Huck searched his comrade’s face keenly. “Tom, have you got on\r\n",
      "the track of that money again?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Huck, it’s in the cave!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Huck’s eyes blazed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Say it again, Tom.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The money’s in the cave!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tom—honest injun, now—is it fun, or earnest?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Earnest, Huck—just as earnest as ever I was in my life. Will you go in\r\n",
      "there with me and help get it out?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I bet I will! I will if it’s where we can blaze our way to it and not\r\n",
      "get lost.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Huck, we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the\r\n",
      "world.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good as wheat! What makes you think the money’s—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Huck, you just wait till we get in there. If we don’t find it I’ll\r\n",
      "agree to give you my drum and every thing I’ve got in the world. I will,\r\n",
      "by jings.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All right—it’s a whiz. When do you say?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Right now, if you say it. Are you strong enough?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is it far in the cave? I ben on my pins a little, three or four days,\r\n",
      "now, but I can’t walk more’n a mile, Tom—least I don’t think I could.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s about five mile into there the way anybody but me would go, Huck,\r\n",
      "but there’s a mighty short cut that they don’t anybody but me know\r\n",
      "about. Huck, I’ll take you right to it in a skiff. I’ll float the skiff\r\n",
      "down there, and I’ll pull it back again all by myself. You needn’t ever\r\n",
      "turn your hand over.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Less start right off, Tom.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All right. We want some bread and meat, and our pipes, and a little\r\n",
      "bag or two, and two or three kite-strings, and some of these new-fangled\r\n",
      "things they call lucifer matches. I tell you, many’s the time I wished I\r\n",
      "had some when I was in there before.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a citizen who\r\n",
      "was absent, and got under way at once. When they were several miles\r\n",
      "below “Cave Hollow,” Tom said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from the\r\n",
      "cave hollow—no houses, no wood-yards, bushes all alike. But do you see\r\n",
      "that white place up yonder where there’s been a landslide? Well, that’s\r\n",
      "one of my marks. We’ll get ashore, now.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They landed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now, Huck, where we’re a-standing you could touch that hole I got out\r\n",
      "of with a fishing-pole. See if you can find it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Huck searched all the place about, and found nothing. Tom proudly\r\n",
      "marched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Here you are! Look at it, Huck; it’s the snuggest hole in this country.\r\n",
      "You just keep mum about it. All along I’ve been wanting to be a robber,\r\n",
      "but I knew I’d got to have a thing like this, and where to run across\r\n",
      "it was the bother. We’ve got it now, and we’ll keep it quiet, only we’ll\r\n",
      "let Joe Harper and Ben Rogers in—because of course there’s got to be a\r\n",
      "Gang, or else there wouldn’t be any style about it. Tom Sawyer’s Gang—it\r\n",
      "sounds splendid, don’t it, Huck?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, it just does, Tom. And who’ll we rob?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, most anybody. Waylay people—that’s mostly the way.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And kill them?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, not always. Hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What’s a ransom?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Money. You make them raise all they can, off’n their friends; and after\r\n",
      "you’ve kept them a year, if it ain’t raised then you kill them. That’s\r\n",
      "the general way. Only you don’t kill the women. You shut up the women,\r\n",
      "but you don’t kill them. They’re always beautiful and rich, and awfully\r\n",
      "scared. You take their watches and things, but you always take your hat\r\n",
      "off and talk polite. They ain’t anybody as polite as robbers—you’ll see\r\n",
      "that in any book. Well, the women get to loving you, and after they’ve\r\n",
      "been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and after that\r\n",
      "you couldn’t get them to leave. If you drove them out they’d turn right\r\n",
      "around and come back. It’s so in all the books.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, it’s real bully, Tom. I believe it’s better’n to be a pirate.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, it’s better in some ways, because it’s close to home and circuses\r\n",
      "and all that.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole, Tom in\r\n",
      "the lead. They toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel, then\r\n",
      "made their spliced kite-strings fast and moved on. A few steps brought\r\n",
      "them to the spring, and Tom felt a shudder quiver all through him.\r\n",
      "He showed Huck the fragment of candle-wick perched on a lump of clay\r\n",
      "against the wall, and described how he and Becky had watched the flame\r\n",
      "struggle and expire.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The boys began to quiet down to whispers, now, for the stillness and\r\n",
      "gloom of the place oppressed their spirits. They went on, and presently\r\n",
      "entered and followed Tom’s other corridor until they reached the\r\n",
      "“jumping-off place.” The candles revealed the fact that it was not\r\n",
      "really a precipice, but only a steep clay hill twenty or thirty feet\r\n",
      "high. Tom whispered:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now I’ll show you something, Huck.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He held his candle aloft and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Look as far around the corner as you can. Do you see that? There—on the\r\n",
      "big rock over yonder—done with candle-smoke.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tom, it’s a _cross_!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“_Now_ where’s your Number Two? ‘_under the cross_,’ hey? Right yonder’s\r\n",
      "where I saw Injun Joe poke up his candle, Huck!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Huck stared at the mystic sign awhile, and then said with a shaky voice:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tom, less git out of here!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What! and leave the treasure?”\r\n",
